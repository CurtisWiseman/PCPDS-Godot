Wow. My first day at PCP University!
My last school thew me out for being too retarted and not being able to finish my assignments.
Will this place be any better? Who knows, I might finally find some friends or even ...Love?
A cool breeze greets me this morning.
As I walk by the entrance to a dinky alley on my way to campus, a slim guy with fluffy hair nearly walks straight into me.
