Almost a week has passed since I last talked to Tom, despite the fact that we see each other in some of our courses.

It’s not like I blame the guy. I haven’t initiated a conversation either after all, what with the weird tension that would obviously result from one dude offering the other to be their private cheerleader or something of the sorts.

What the fuck was I even thinking? I’m new here. I have no pull whatsoever. How could I possibly be a valuable asset?

Stupid.

Guess that’s just the effect that cool things have; You want them to be appreciated, you want others to share your amazement and you ruin your relationship with the creator by being a fucking Idiot. 

A dolt.
 
A piece of fucking garbage.
 
Shit!/n I let out my frustration on an innocent piece of chicken by ramming a fork into it.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, ShockMIN, offright, slide, center) Hey, having a bad day?
 
(PCPG) I might have screwed up a friendship in record time… /n
Have a seat! I’d love to be distracted.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, SadMIN) That’s no good, have you tried to talk it over?
 
Gib pushes another green-purple election reminder aside to make place for his food.
 
(PCPG) Haven’t had the balls yet.

(PCPG) What’s with that student council election anyways? Do you know who’s running?
 
His face suggests that he doesn’t quite understand the question.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, press, ConfusedMIN) Well, Endless War. It’s the Student Council after all.
 
(PCPG) Yeah sure, I know that she’s the president and that Mage is the vice, but who are the other contestants? I don’t see any campaigning.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, Neutral) Oh, there are no other contestants, there haven’t been in years.
 
(PCPG) Is it such a hard job? I would assume that some people would have a go at it for the prestige alone.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, press, ShockMIN) Maybe..? I don’t know, but Mage has done such a great job representing the student body that no one really sees the need to replace her, and people are just scared of Endless War.

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, Neutral) The thought of running probably isn’t crossing anyone’s mind because of that, so they’ve been unopposed forever.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, clenched, ShockMED) Why? Do you want to be student council president?
 
(PCPG) No. No, but I just might have an idea about how to set some things right./n Sorry Gib, I’ve gotta go!

[SLIDE, Gibbon, center, offright]
 
Determined I quickly make my way to the cafeteria doors.

[Gibbon leaves]

Along the way Gib says something to me that I can’t quite hear over the sound of students, who are for some reason chanting Evanescence songs with varying levels of skill and sincerity, but instead of turning back, I just shout:
 
(PCPG) You can have the rest of it!
 
Hoping that he asked something along the lines of “What about your meal?”

Sprinting around corners and jumping down flights of stairs, I push the movement mechanics of life to their very limit, at extreme detriment to every joint in my body. 

I only barely avoid eating shit on multiple occasions before reaching my locker. 

On any other day, I might have some concerns about irreparably fucking up my spine pulling stunts like this and waste time contemplating what a bummer that would be, but not today. Not now. Not with a friendship on the line.
 
I rip the fucker open in search of my phone, but something else catches my eye first. A note.
 
“Hey,/n I’m sorry for acting like a dick. Really./n Still kinda stand by what I said, though.”

“Look, you’re a nice dude, which is exactly why you shouldn’t make yourself part of this train wreck.” 

“It’s really flattering that you like my shit, but we can be pals without you feeling obligated to be my hype-man.” 

“Just do your own things and come over for some wine, so we can leave this uncomfortable situation behind us./n -Tom”
 
Damn it. The fucker beat me to the apologetic punch and didn’t even make it part of some overly convoluted scheme that cost them at least half a plate of perfectly good chicken and tea already. 

Oh well, someone DID put in the effort, so get the wine ready Tom, cause the game is fucking on.

(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Hey, you got the note?
 
(PCPG) Yes, and you know what? Fuck. You.

(PCPG) What was it? Indie but not alone? You want a pal? Well guess what: I’m the palliest pal in the whole fucking world over here, and helping each other is what pals do.

(PCPG) You can’t just tell people about your problems and subsequently shoot them down when they’re trying to be supportive.

(PCPG) So I guess what I’m saying is: Apology accepted, now listen to my fucking marketing proposal.
 
Tom understandably looks a bit taken aback. Just standing there, a bottle of liquor in one hand and two glasses in the other. 

After a second of unbearable silence, he finally stretches the hand with the glasses out towards me.
 
(Tom, whisky, confusedMIN) So, what’s the plan?
 
(PCPG) Maybe we should get to drinking first. A pretty smart guy once told me that we wouldn’t survive the semester sober.
 
(Tom, whisky, neutral) He might have been overly optimistic in suggesting that survival was ever an option to begin with. Honestly, I’m starting to get scared with all this preamble.
 
(PCPG) I’d say it’s worth a shot, and excessive optimism might be just what we need.
 
(Tom, whisky, happyMAX) To survival then.
 
(PCPG) Cheers!
 
Great wine once again. Notes of rye and trials ahead swirl in my mouth, though the latter may be contextual.
 
(Tom, 2, happyMIN) Seriously though, tell me what the fucking plan is already, so I can finally call you insane.
 
(PCPG) Fair. The scheme really isn’t all that ridiculous in theory.

(PCPG) We’ll simply run a baller marketing campaign, to get you elected as student council president, therefore putting you in a position of relevance, from which it will be far easier to market your game and almost impossible for them to revoke your scholarship.
 
(Tom, 2, confusedMIN) Is that it?
 
(PCPG) If it sounds too easy we could also add a few steps and expand the student council’s influence to Kill La Kill levels of absurdity.

(PCPG) Get our own troop of obsequious butlers and shit. That would be neat.
 
(Tom, whisky, confusedMIN) No, I just meant is that the entirety of your plan?
 
(PCPG) Essentially yes? It’s missing all the details, but I didn’t even know if you’d agree, so this is more of an outline.
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) You’re insane.

(PCPG) Well, are you in?
 
(Tom, whisky, happyMAX) Oh for sure. I’ve watched enough shounen to know that insane plans are the only ones that ever work.
 
(Tom, 4, confusedMAX) Just making sure: You don’t have any practical ideas on how to beat Mage, do you?

(PCPG) Why Mage? Shouldn’t we primarily be worried about Endless War?

(Tom, 4, shockedMIN) She is more likely to kill us, true, but the students are voting for Mage./n She’s the one they can talk to.

(Tom, whisky, neutral) Endless War is just an egomaniacal psychopath who won’t accept being the VICE president, so Mage takes the backseat.

(Tom, 3, angryMIN) If we’re running, we’re running against Mage first and foremost, so what have you got?
 
(PCPG) You’ve been at this school for far longer than I have… Why do students vote for her? Is there any dirt we can use? What are the hot button issues we can capitalize on?
 
(Tom, 2, shockedMAX) She’s sweet, genuine, constantly helps people out, so much so that some students call her “mom,” and has done a great job for years.

(Tom, 2, shockedMAX) The fact that she’s a girl also helps probably, but I’m guessing you didn’t want a list of reasons why we can’t realistically win this.
 
(PCPG) Come on, there has to be a chink in her armor, anything exploitable will do.
 
(Tom, whisky, angryMIN) Believe me, you really don’t want that. These people know Mage and they love her. If it seems like we’re leading a smear-campaign, we’re done for, not that I’d want anything to do with that anyways.
 
(Tom, whisky, confusedMIN) As for hot button issues, we’d honestly have to ask the students. I spent most of my time sitting somewhere working on a video game. I don’t know what they want.
 
(PCPG) I guess that’s my first job then: Finding out what these sheep even want from their leader./n Tom Oliver – Man of the People… I like the ring of that.

(Tom, 3, smittenMAX) It might be a bit much… Just a taaaaaad cliche, don’t you think?

(PCPG) You’re the one who left a literal, physical, hand written note in my locker, so cliche really shouldn’t be a problem for you.

(Tom, whisky, confusedMAX) What are you expecting here? Social competence?

(PCPG) That’s not a bad thing, because it shouldn’t be a problem for you. People love cliches, they eat that shit up.

Tom lifts his glass once more.
 
(Tom, whisky, drunkMAX) To market research.
 
(PCPG) To market research.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMAX) So, that concludes our discussion of why this show sucks fucking dick. If you think that I’m full of shit, write me a fucking essay on why you think it’s good, and if you do an okay job, I’ll read it.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, AngryMIN) But if you’re just gonna call me a contrarian douchebag, you can get out right now, kid. Any questions that aren’t stupid?
 
(PCPG) Yeah. What would you want from a student council?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, AngryMED) Subject related questions. You didn’t pay for that rant.
 
I bust out my wallet and slam ten bucks down on his desk. Not sure if he’s actually allowed to take money from students, but getting the most popular professor on our side is probably worth the investment.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, ConfusedMIN) They should just let me do what I want with my courses. Not that I’m not doing that anyways, but ideally the student council would be entirely irrelevant to what I’m doing.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, AngryMED) Maybe they could recommend my classes to more people instead of perpetually fucking with what topics are advertised to whom, but that’s pretty much it.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, ConfusedMIN) I really don’t know why you would want me to rant about this.
 
Colossal waste of money… Not doing anything isn’t a platform someone can run on, and I’m pretty sure that recommending courses isn’t the job of the student council anyways. 

Fuck.
 
Suddenly I feel a tap on my shoulder.
 
(Davoo, thinking, neutral, offleft, slide, left) If you ask me, what the student council does doesn’t matter as much as the fact that they do it.

(Davoo, thinking, neutral) There has to be some notion of progress, or else it’s just a big ol’ waste of time, isn’t it? If they would friggin commit to anything, we’d be getting somewhere.
 
(PCPG) Anything else?
 
(Davoo, fidgeting, happyMIN) I guess they could abolish event items on the cafeteria menu.

(Davoo, fidgeting, confusedMIN) Fucking keto pizza is a permanent option, so why the hell can’t I have pretzel buns whenever the fuck I feel like eating a pretzel burger?
 
(PCPG) Okay, that sounds doable… I have to ask some more people, write an email or something if you have other ideas.

On my way to Professor Saint’s philosophy class, an obstacle which I had almost forgotten about blocks my path, ready to set an end to my information gathering and my being in general.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, Campus, Pointing, AngryMED|shades, offleft, slide, center) I had high hopes for you, you know? That you would put in the effort and dedicate your LIFE to this school. So…

(Nate|Professor Bestman, Campus, Papers, AngryMED|shades) Where were you in class last week PCPG? What do you have to say for yourself?!
 
(PCPG) I… umm…I didn’t want to be a cog in the machine...?

A heavy silence hangs in the air and I try my best to look just the right amount of scared and sincere without quite knowing what the right amount is exactly. 

Nate’s eyes are hidden behind shades, but there is no doubt in my mind that he is staring right into my soul and judging my moral character with utmost accuracy. 

This is the kind of silence which precedes executions and utterances of the word...
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, Campus, Papers, ConfusedMIN|shades) What?!
 
(PCPG) I’m working on a bunch of projects right now, and since attendance isn’t mandatory, skipping it from time to time is the sensible thing to do to maximize my effectiveness as a human being…?
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, Campus, Smoking, HappyMED|shades) Oh. Well if I ever see you lazing about somewhere, wasting VALUABLE minutes, that you could be spending in MY class, prepare to be fucking eviscerated.
 
(PCPG) I’ll make sure not to.
 
(PCPG) Actually, I’m doing some field research right now, so it would be great if you could tell me what you would want from a student council.
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, Campus, Smoking, ConfusedMAX|shades) They would have to definitively prove to me that they have what it takes and that they’re the best people for the job.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, Campus, Smoking, AngryMED|shades) Any second they spend on pointless bullshit is time that could be used to get us closer to fucking starfleet, and that is a crime that can never be forgiven.

(Endless War, Cross, AngryMAX) Anyone who proclaims themselves to be a ruler needs to stand at least waist deep in blood and slime.

(Endless War, Knife, AngryMED) A student council can only be legitimate if all other student councils have been eliminated with extreme prejudice and not a single soul dares to stand in their way.
 
(PCPG) I’m pretty sure there can only ever be one student council, so rivals aren’t really the issue…
 
(Endless War, Knife, Neutral) Oh but they are. There are always rivals, so there will always be ENDLESS war.

(Endless War, Knife, Neutral) Rowdy or Killer, PCPG. Rowdy or Killer?
 
(PCPG) I’ve gotta go.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, happyMIN, offleft, slide, left) Well in this troper’s humble opinion, the student council’s job should be to build alternative infrastructure and counter institutions which would facilitate a dual power takeover of the school and a democratic redistribution of influence and resources.
 
(PCPG) Isn’t the pyramid scheme already an alternative power structure? Also what resources do you want to redistribute?
 
(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, exasp, angryMIN) No you fucking idiot, they’re a parallel power structure. They’re so intricately interwoven with the school itself, that I wouldn’t be surprised if the same guy was behind it.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, exasp, angryMIN) That might sound like a conspiracy theory, and maybe it is, but it would be completely unsurprising.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, exasp, angryMIN) As for the resources, let’s just say that there are a lot of corporate-ass fat cats with way more slime than anyone could possibly need, and I think we might be better off without them if you catch my drift.

Who better to ask than the guidance counselor? This is where students come with their problems after all, and boy do I have some problems with the awful suggestions I’ve gotten so far.

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_1, angryMIN) Come in and bow before the footwear man.
 
(PCPG) But I’m already in.
 
(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_1, angryMAX) Then bow. It’s the least you can do if you crawl in here, asking for my help like it’s my job. You people disgust me.
 
(PCPG) Well it is your job, isn’t it?

(PCPG) Anyways, I wanted to ask you what you think the student council should be doing.
 
(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_3, happyMED) Well that’s easy. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but there are a bunch of really stupid pieces of shit at this school, and there’s nothing we can legally do about that.
 
(PCPG) So you mean like correctional measures or something?
 
(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_3, angryMAX) What? No! I should be allowed to fucking kill ‘em.

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_4, angryMAX) Everyone should be allowed to kill everybody and then no one would be a worthless garbage-human anymore. Do you know for how long I’ve wanted a trapdoor in front of this room so I could get rid of these fuckers?

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_4, angryMAX) Forever!

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_4, angryMAX) But oh no, that would be a far too extreme measure, they say. “You’re deranged,” they say. You know what I say to them?

*Point out that he’s only worked here for a week at best*
*Ask him what he says to them*
*Talk political theory*

*Point out that he’s only worked here for a week at best*

(PCPG) Didn’t Digi hire you a few days ago?

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_1, confusedMIN) How is that relevant? Now answer the rhetorical question!

(PCPG) Fine. What do you say to them?
*

*Ask him what he says to them*

(PCPG) What do you say to them?

*Talk political theory*

(PCPG) What kind of weird, stirnerite ideology is this?

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_3, happyMED) It’s called anarcho-fascism™.

(PCPG) I don’t think you can trademark that.

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_3, angryMED) Well I have to, because some piece of shit imbecile wrote a wikipedia article about a wrong thing with the same name to SPITE me and ruin my funny made up political beliefs.

(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_4, angryMAX) Except I’m serious about them. This is the REAL anarcho fascism, the ideology of the REAL AMERICA.

(PCPG) Riiiiiiight. So, what do you say to people who call you deranged?
*
 
(Jesse|Dr. Horseshoes, campus, campus_4, angryMAX) Well that’s exactly the problem; I don’t want to say anything to them, I want to fucking kill them for having the audacity not to understand that living with these people is far worse than death could ever be.

(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, Campus, Squatting, AngryMAX) There’s one thing that’s KEY for a student council, that’s so fucking ESSENTIAL, that the human mind isn’t even CAPABLE of comprehending it, and that’s that they have to bring YOUNG BLOOD.

(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, Campus, Squatting, AngryMAX) They have to be zoomer-ass enlightened children of the EARTH, just like me, because their minds are so fucking PURE that they can manifest the future that god wanted without even THINKING about it.

(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, Campus, Squatting, AngryMAX) They can rid the universe of this cynical fucking Ben Saint boomer debauchery that has ruined this school.
 
(PCPG) In what way do you consider the school to be ruined, and how is it professor Saint’s fault?
 
(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, Campus, Crossing, ConfusedMED) LITERALLY fucking obvious. This whole place is in such fucking SPIRITUAL DECAY, that I can’t even sense my OWN chakras.

(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, Campus, Crossing, AngryMED) Oh, and they HAVE to be able to draw, because people who can’t draw: Literally not real people, actually not even real.
 
(PCPG) Young and able to draw, got it.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, ShockMIN, offright, slide, right) So are you actually serious about this whole student council thing?
 
(PCPG) I guess. For reasons too convoluted to get into, this is really important to help a friend, and it’s the only plan I could come up with, so yeah, I’m doing this for real.

(PCPG) Why, are you going to tell me that it’s impossible?
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, Neutral) No. It’s going to be hard, sure, and I don’t know how to do it, but I’ve done hard things before, and if you really put in the effort and work smart and don’t give up, then it works, and you can be like:

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, HappyMIN) Yeah, I did this thing, and it was hard, but I did it, so I guess it wasn’t really hard at all.
 
(PCPG) Huh. Well I certainly don’t intend on giving up.

(PCPG) Thanks for the motivation. All the weird suggestions for what a student council SHOULD be almost had me believing that this is an impossible quest, so I guess I needed that.

(PCPG) Hey, sorry for just running off during lunch.
 
(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, press, ConfusedMIN) Oh no problem, I could tell that it was important.
 
(Mage, Campus, 1, HappyMED, offleft, slide, left) Hey Gib, PCPG, what are you talking about?
 
(PCPG) Hi Mage! I’ve been going around asking people about their expectations and wishes for the student council, and getting awful results, because ninety percent of people here are apparently lunatics.

(PCPG) So, what would you want from the student council?
 
(Mage, Campus, 4, ConfusedMIN) Shouldn’t I be asking you that?

(Mage, Campus, 4, ShockMIN) Listening to what the students and professors want is kind of my job, and yeah, some of their ideas are a bit weird, but I’m sure they only really mean half of them.

Okay, the results are… less than stellar, let’s say. 

Maybe even completely worthless, but isn’t that what marketing is all about, to figure out how to sell the idea of something to people who don’t even know what they want themselves? 

I’m sure we can figure something out as a team. We have data now, that’s a start.

*Just fucking tell him*
*Try thinking about how to spin this*

*Just fucking tell him*

Here goes nothing

(PCPG) Tom, I have no Idea how to tell you this, but running for office at this school is impossible.

(PCPG) It’s genuinely not a course of action that is even remotely pursuable for anyone who isn’t completely bonkers.

(Tom, whisky, happyMAX) Oh, I know, but what finally convinced you?

(PCPG) You don’t understand: These people are too autistic to be catered to.

(PCPG) All of them.

(PCPG) Is that an acceptance criterion for this place?

(Tom, 4, happyMIN) Might be. Actually no, I’m absolutely certain that it is, but still; what have you got?

(PCPG) No, really, you’d have to be insane…

(Tom, whisky, smittenMIN) Maybe I am. I agreed to your plan after all. And besides; what did I tell you about insane?
 
(PCPG) It’s the only thing that works…?
 
(Tom, 2, shockedMIN) Exactly. So, point by point, what do these lunatics want?
*

*Try thinking about how to spin this*

Right, let’s think this through. 

Oh fuck, he’s looking at me. Take a sip of rum and think of an opener.

Shit, I mean wine. 

I’m a failure, I don’t know how to do this./n Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
 
(Tom, whisky, neutral) So, how did the field research go?
 
(PCPG) It was… good. We have some really insightful stuff to build a strategy out of.
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) Don’t fucking lie to me. It’s garbage, got it. That’s still more than we started with, so hit me. Step by step, I’m sure we can glean something from it.
 
(PCPG) Yeah… how could you tell?

(Tom, 4, confusedMIN) Maybe the fact that you’ve been sitting here for ten minutes without saying a word and drinking whenever I look at you?

(PCPG) Anyways, It’s insane bullcrap and we’re probably better off sticking to standard campaign strategies.
 
(Tom, 4, confusedMIN) Maybe. Still, what did I tell you about insane?


(PCPG) It’s the only thing that works…?
 
(Tom, whisky, happyMIN) Exactly. So once more, point by point, what do these lunatics want?
*

(PCPG) Half of it was just ideas for revamping the entire social order, into… some kind of communist regime under which you get to kill people, I guess.
 
(Tom, 1, confusedMIN) Ben?
 
(PCPG) Yeah, also the guidance counselor.

(PCPG) That’s not even within the power of a student council, and even if it was it would be ridiculous. How the fuck are we supposed to work with that?
 
(Tom, whisky, shockedMAX) No, actually that’s pretty helpful?
 
(PCPG) How? How in the hell could that possibly be helpful?
 
(Tom, 4, drunkMIN) Because we’re not really marketing a product. Well, we are, but that’s usually not how the voters see it.

(Tom, whisky, drunkMIN) We are marketing a person and a set of values that the consumer agrees with, so that they would want to support us for who we are, not for what we make.
 
(PCPG) You really wanna go with “equality and manslaughter, that’s what we stand for”?
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN) God no, that’s way to specific. But both those things play really nicely into some kind of revolutionary aesthetic that we could use.

(Tom, 2, sadMIN) This is a university after all, what could possibly be more attractive than rebellion?
 
(PCPG) Free tuition?
 
(Tom, whisky, happyMAX) Well, maybe we can utilize some of the communist stuff.
 
(PCPG) Okay, let’s stage a protest, I guess.
 
(Tom, 3, drunkMAX) This was meant to happen. Stage one of project election: “revolt!”./n Do you have a facemask?

Two more weeks until election day, and we’re kicking our campaign off with one hell of a stunt.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN|antifa-mask) Students of PCPU, your liberation has come, if only you are willing to take it!
 
Here we are, dressed in all black, facemasks and sunglasses, standing on a pile of desks, that we arranged in the corridor at four in the morning. The Man won’t be able to ignore us now. 

I don’t quite know whom I mean by “The Man”, but it fits with the aesthetic, so fuck it.
 
(PCPG) The student council, helpful as they may be, has not solved the fundamental problems that plague your life.
 
The alternating speaker thing was my idea and I’m relatively pleased with how it’s working out. Really helps with selling this thing as a movement.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN|antifa-mask) And that’s because systematic problems require radical solutions and good old collaboration - peaceful reform isn’t gonna cut it.
 
(PCPG) For the past semesters, each student council election had only one candidate, for those capable of inspiring change were too cowardly to stand up and fight besides their fellow students!
 
(Tom, 2, shockMAX|antifa-mask) Well not anymore, because those who have to be courageous now are all of you. Now there is a choice.
 
(PCPG) You may choose to stick with the status quo, if you decide that the raging gang war, the pernicious pyramid scheme, the slime disparity and all the other inconveniences that you have to deal with day after day aren’t real problems at all.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMAX|antifa-mask) Or you may choose to actually make a difference, to right what is wrong and to fight alongside us!
 
Tom rips his mask off and throws it into the sea of students, some of whom are listening attentively out of fascination or amusement, while others are trying to make their way past us to get to their classes.
 
(Tom, 1, happyMAX) I’m Tom Oliver, some of you may know me, and I’ll be running for council president.

(Tom, 2, confusedMAX) If I am to topple the old elites, then I’m going to need the help of every last one of you. Some have joined our movement already, small as it may still be. This…
 
Tom points at me, and I too remove my mask.
 
(Tom, 2, happyMIN) … is PCPG, and he’s going to be my vice president.
 
Some students cheer, others retain their expression of perplexed disbelief.
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) The status quo has failed, so vote Oliver and spread the word!
 
At this point, I proposed to drop a smoke bomb and vanish, but apparently those don't actually work too well, so we’ll just let this introductory event slowly degrade into an open forum.

Did I say slowly?/n Forget that.
 
(Davoo, greeting, ConfusedMIN, offleft, slide, left) 

Davoo steps out of the mass of students almost immediately.
 
(Davoo, greeting, ConfusedMIN) What about the artificial scarcity of pretzel buns in the cafeteria of PCPU?
 
(PCPG) Consider it fixed! The Revolution won’t stop at food products and it won‘t stop at anything else!
 
(9/11, concern, offright, slide, right) How do you intend to melt those steel beams?
 
(Tom, 1, happyMAX) I can’t discuss this in detail, but believe me, the pillars that uphold the establishment will crumble before us, and all it takes is your support!

(Tom, 1, confusedMAX)
 
(PCPG) I’d say that worked pretty well, we had a decent amount of people who stuck around for the whole thing and we absolutely nailed the aesthetic.

(PCPG) I have a good feeling about this.
 
(Tom, 1, confusedMAX) Sure, we definitely piqued the interest of some, the question is how many from this crowd will actually stick around, and how many just took in the spectacle while it lasted.
 
(PCPG) So we need a way to capitalize on the initial boost and make sure the momentum doesn’t die down.
 
(Tom, 4, shockedMAX) Exactly. I’m thinking merchandise maybe? Shirts and shit for students to openly show their allegiance and make the whole thing propagate itself.
 
(PCPG) Sounds good, would probably help to turn this into some kind of movement, but I have another idea for a marketing stunt.
 
(Tom,1, happyMIN) Hit me, what is it?
 
(PCPG) Well, when I did that little opinion poll, Nate and Endless War put a lot of emphasis on the importance of competition and proving yourself directly, so I was thinking about organizing a little contest.
 
(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) How do you turn the qualities associated with being the council president into a competition?
 
(PCPG) I don’t think we have to. What you beat Mage at is likely irrelevant to most everyone, but the benefits would still be twofold.

(PCPG) For one, participating in any kind of high profile event gives us free publicity, and secondly, having won against your opponent at anything is simply a good look. Who wouldn’t want to vote for someone who wins things?
 
(Tom, 2, shockedMAX) Don’t tell me you’re proposing that I compete in THAT game show?

[Choice]

*Propose being a candidate on Ten Paces And Draw*
*Pretend not to know what he’s talking about*
 
*Propose being a candidate on Ten Paces And Draw*

(PCPG) Hell yes I am!

(PCPG) Mage is gonna be there and half the school will watch, it’s perfect!
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) You do realize that they make the person who’s second to last in each round wear a silly hat, right? That’s not a good look.

(PCPG) Good thing that you’re not gonna come in second to last then. 
*

*Pretend not to know what he’s talking about*

(PCPG) What game show?

Tom looks deeply sceptical and I’m not quite sure why I bother keeping this from him.

(Tom, 1, confusedMIN) The enormous competition about drawing… you didn’t consider signing me up for that, did you?

(PCPG) No, of course not, but speaking of drawing; would you say you’re good at it?

Tom’s brow furrows.
*

(PCPG) You study art for god’s sake, what is there to worry about?
 
(Tom, 2, angryMAX) The fuck do you mean “what’s there to worry about”? You’re in the art course and I’ve seen your attempt at drawing election posters!
 
(PCPG) First of all: harsh. I’m pretty sure I got the idea across with those posters. And second: without any sardonic self-deprecating bullshit; can you or can you not draw?
 
(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) I guess I’m alright, though maybe my skills have gotten a bit rusty since I focused on 3D and gamedev. Hell, I can barely remember what a pencil is.

(Tom, 3, sadMIN) Not that it matters, since the deadline for applications was yesterday and the next event won’t be until after the election.
 
(PCPG) Come on, I’d be a piss poor excuse for a campaign manager If I hadn’t taken care of that beforehand.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMAX) You signed me up without my consent, and without even KNOWING IF I COULD DRAW?!
 
(PCPG) I have your consent now, and it was sort of a last minute idea and therefore asking wasn’t really an option.

(PCPG) Also you’re the coding 3D analysis guy who told me that an indie creator needs to be able to do everything, so I think I took an almost boringly safe bet in assuming that you could draw.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN) You fool! You literally have my phone number, how last minute could it have possibly been for there to not be any time to call me?
 
(PCPG) I bumped into professor Digibro as he was leaving his office, and while helping him pick up the documents he was carrying, I put your name on the list of participants.

(PCPG) So I guess that qualifies as post last minute?

(Tom, 1, confusedMIN)

Tom laughs.
 
(Tom, 2, happyMIN) It’s settled then, wanna come over for a drink while I do some preparatory doodling?
 
(PCPG) Gladly. Do you have any wine?

Ten Paces And Draw, as the event is called, is a beloved gameshow at PCPU which is broadcast across the campus, and whose betting profits allegedly rival those of the school’s cannabis trade. 

Facts, of course, of which I, as a newcomer, was up to this point entirely unaware of, causing the determined stares of the doubtlessly proficient drawbois who fill the room to send shivers down my spine.

(Tom, 1, neutral, offright, slide, center)

(PCPG) Sooo, It appears that I had slightly misguided expectations for the scale of this thing… anything I need to know?
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) Yeah no shit? I tried to tell you, but you kept claiming that I was exaggerating.

(Tom, 2, angryMIN) Why would you need tips anyways? You’re not even participating.
 
(PCPG) In my defense, that seemed way more likely than the school having a TV-scale art iron chef rip-off.

(PCPG) Also, I’m managing your social media… Project S.U.M., remember?

(PCPG) Don’t you think that having a bit of context would increase my likelihood of selling this thing with befitting amounts of drama and gravitas?
 
(Tom, 4, confusedMIN) Fair enough. The judges are Digi and Nate. They’re gonna be a bunch of obnoxious jackasses, but they’re gonna be that way for everyone, so don’t claim bias or complain about them being needlessly harsh.

(Tom, 4, angryMIN) It’s just how the show works, and people who watch it would see me as a whiny bitch.
 
(PCPG) Okay, noted. What about the other contestants?
 
(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) It’s a timed challenge, so people with a more simplistic general style definitely have an advantage, meaning that Ben and Munchy pose a real threat.

(Tom, 3, confusedMAX) Since Mage creates detailed drawings unbelievably quickly though, we shouldn’t discount her either.

(Tom, 3, confusedMAX) The other thing that’s important is that humor is just as essential as execution, if not more, and a funny interpretation of the theme will go a long way, so Gib’s fucking dangerous on that front.
 
(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN, offright, slide, right)

Gib smiles at me and waves. There’s no way on earth his participation has any malice to it but I still feel a bit betrayed.

[SLIDE, Gibbon, right, offright]

[Gibbon leaves]

(PCPG) But they’re like the established drawbois of PCPU, right?
 
(Tom, 4, shockedMIN) I guess, yeah, why?
 
(PCPG) Well, you said yourself that you haven’t drawn in a long time, so you’re kinda off the radar, which means that this makes for a highly compelling underdog story.
 
(Tom, 1, happyMIN) And it plays perfectly into the style of our campaign in general. Definitely use that. I just hope I get far enough to capitalize on it.
 
(PCPG) On it! And don’t worry, you’ll do great!
 
With that, the show begins, and I am pushed away from the filming area to sit somewhere in the hallway and watch the event unfold like everyone else; hunched over my smartphone.

The first few rounds don’t go particularly well, with Tom ending up wearing the jester hat every single time, though not for a lack of stunning artwork. 

On the plus side: He’s still in the race, but so is Mage, unfortunately, meaning that the battle is far from won.

A brief recess between rounds allows me precious seconds to trade pep talks with my partner in crime.
 
(Tom, 1, confusedMIN, offright, slide, center) How goes the social media?
 
(PCPG) It could be better… some rowdies are really digging the clown look for obvious reasons, but most people have their favorites and don’t give too much of a shit about the other candidates.
 
(Tom, 3, confusedMAX) And I’m assuming Mage is quite a few students’ favorite?
 
(PCPG) Oh the audience is going nuts for her ever since she started coloring her drawings. How the fuck is she doing that anyways?
 
(Tom, 3, shockedMAX) I have no idea, she has literally the same pencil as the rest of us and yet there she goes, using multiple shades of purple like a fucking magic art monster.
 
(PCPG) Of course Mage the great and powerful would never reveal her tricks.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN) Jesus fuck, I should have never told you about the pony shit, one more reference and you’re fired.
 
(PCPG) Aren’t you… curious?
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN) You’re treading on very thin ice here.
 
(PCPG) Oh come on, that’s a perfectly normal context to use that word in, I’m not trying to fuck with you.
 
I was of course trying to fuck with him, and seeing how he’s gotten noticeably less tense, the risky conversational maneuver was a success. 

It’s funny how effortless our interactions have become over the past few weeks, despite the stress of a doomed-to-fail election campaign. 

Losing myself in those deep, brown eyes, as he’s talking, I can’t help but feel a desire to become more than his marketing assistant. More than his friend even…
 
(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Hey, are you listening? The next round is starting, I’ve got to go.
 
(PCPG) Yeah, definitely. Best of luck!

Gib is eliminated despite excellent punsmanship, leaving only Mage and a still clown-hat-wearing Tom to move on to the finale. 

The political significance of the matchup isn’t lost on attentive audience members all across campus and I’m starting to fear that this plan might horribly backfire.

(Tom, 1, confusedMAX, offright, slide, center)
 
(PCPG) How are you doing?
 
(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) Overwhelmed… mostly?

(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) Really didn’t think I’d make it this far, and being this close to elimination each and every round isn’t the most hope-inspiring thing in the world.
 
(PCPG) Understandable, do you want something to drink?
 
(Tom, 1, confusedMIN) Pretty sure the judges wouldn’t take too kindly to me throwing up on my drawing, so I’ll pass. What are the people thinking?
 
(PCPG) The showdown between you and Mage is received the way we wanted it to be, and a particularly vocal contingent of Saint-heads has come to use the TPAD hashtag on communist memes featuring your face.

(PCPG) They switched when their favorite professor got eliminated and are generally aiding me in my propaganda, so that’s good.
 
(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Are they buying T-shirts?
 
(PCPG) Like there’s no tomorrow
 
(Tom, 2, happyMAX) Great, any other news?
 
(PCPG) Some idiots asked things like why you are participating in an event, organized by the system you claim to abhor and received multi-paragraph replies before being blocked.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN) Don’t block them! I know that it isn’t really, but I don’t want to be accused of censorship.
 
(PCPG) Consider it done.

(PCPG) You’d better get back in there, the final round is starting.

The tension that fills the halls of PCPU is palpable, and with Tom having done two different sketches and still clearly unsure, the odds of success are slim at best. 

On a different note, the stream has been cutting out every few seconds, and the motion graphics are noticeably fucked.

[SLIDE, Tom, right, offright]

Five minutes into the round, Tom gets up from his chair and walks off-camera. 

Sounds of confusion echo throughout the building. 

Shortly after, Tom is back in frame, phone in hand and talking to some staffer.

[Slide, Tom, offright, right]

What the fuck is he doing?

He grabs a tablet from someone off-screen and sits back down. People on social media are starting to bitch about the show being explicitly about traditional drawing and this being a violation of the rules. 

What is actually happening reveals itself gradually, as the feed stops cutting out, and the motion graphics find their intended position on-screen.

Only Mage’s drawing is rated this round.

(Tom, 1, sadMAX)

(PCPG) … All I’m saying is that you don’t really know how they’re going to spin this yet. You fixed the stream, they should be thankful.
 
(Tom, 2, sadMIN) You know exactly how they’re going to spin this: I walked away from the competition because I knew that I couldn’t win. I may as well just have given up.
 
(PCPG) You asked Bestman if you could get the time you spent on the technical difficulties to finish, and HE wouldn’t let you. That doesn’t sound like a guy who’s given up.
 
(Tom, 1, sadMIN) Anyone with half a brain knows that Nate wouldn’t give extra time, no matter the circumstances. Could you just admit that we’re doomed so we can leave this behind us?
 
(PCPG) I’ll admit nothing of the sort! Why did you even do it if it’s apparently such a shitty idea?
 
(Tom, 1, confusedMIN) I don’t know? My nerves were fried and people being incompetent at dealing with tech when they could easily look up the solution on the web frustrates me.

(Tom, 2, confusedMIN) That idiot had like five billion unnecessary projects running in the background, his resolution settings were fucked and he hadn’t updated the program in years.
 
(PCPG) Like I said; thanks to you the show could go on, so would you wait for actual reactions before falling into despair over what you think they think?
 
(Tom, 2, sadMAX) This isn’t me “falling into despair”, that happened yesterday. I haven’t slept, we’ve lost and I’m ready to die.
 
(PCPG) Have you considered that the reason you haven’t slept is that you’re way too tall to lie comfortably in your car?
 
(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) Pretty sure the crushing defeat and general feeling of inadequacy also plays a role… actually, I’ve thought about that.

(Tom, 3, sadMIN) Maybe if this whole thing doesn’t work out, I should just leave./n Cut my losses.
 
(PCPG) Leave the school?
 
(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Boston, ideally.

(Tom, 1, neutral) I could sell most of my shit, get in my car and work on Azumi until the money runs out.

(Drug dealer|???, neutral, offleft, slide, left) EXTRA EXTRA! TECHNICAL SCREW UPS AT THE TEN PACES AND DRAW SET, STUDENT COUNCIL CANDIDATE SAVES THE DAY! READ ALL ABOUT IT!

[SLIDE, Drugdealer, left, offleft]

[Drugdealer leaves]
 
(Tom, 2, confusedMIN) What’s it say?
 
(PCPG) “The sick-nasty schoolwide gameshow extravaganza known as ten paces and draw unsurprisingly pulled ill wicked numbers and got viewers way invested, as the broadcast of the program itself stood on the line.”

(PCPG) “The evening and the baller competition contained therein was however miraculously saved though the dope yet tragic self-sacrifice of presidency candidate Tim Olives or some shit,

(PCPG) ...who fixed the fucking internet like a rad tech wizard from those cheesy ass 90s PC-repair commercials, you know what I’m saying?”

(PCPG) “Mage therefore got to wow all of us off our shitty seating contraptions with her totes adorbs pokemon looking thing UWU and the broadcast could continue to transpire normally through a series of events only describable as “way lit, yo”.”

(PCPG) “9/10, not enough purple despite the overwhelming presence thereof./n Peace out dawgs.”
 
(PCPG) You know what this means?
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) That journalism is dead?
 
(PCPG) It means we’re still in the race! You can win this!
 
(Tom, 1, angryMAX) Will you please fucking stop already?!
 
(PCPG) Stop what, Tom?

(PCPG) You can read this dumpster fire of an article yourself if you want to, this is exactly what it says, so stop pretending that you’ve already lost when you clearly haven’t!
 
(Tom, 2, angryMAX) Lying to me! I’m shit and I know that. I wouldn’t have to spend all my time marketing myself if I was actually good.

(Tom, 2, sadMAX) People would flock to me naturally, but they don’t. So be honest with me and accept that I’m a fucking failure!
 
(PCPG) So you’re not M Dot, got it. Most great artists have to sell themselves to get anywhere and some fail despite doing so.

(PCPG) I’d fucking wager that your staggering unwillingness to put yourself in the spotlight is precisely why some people flock to you.

(PCPG) They’re interested in the kind of person who would pass up the greatest publicity stunt imaginable, despite needing exactly that, in order to fix some tech and make everyone’s evening a bit better.

(PCPG) Well guess what?

(PCPG) If you truly want Azumi to be a household name, you’re gonna have to sell yourself, so call yourself stupid or shit, or a failure or any of that crap on the campaign trail one more time, and I swear to god, I will punch you.
 
(Tom, 1, sadMIN) Alright, I’ll try. Azumi’s worth more to me than my dignity, so I’ll have to, but I don’t think that’ll ever stop me from wanting to be like M Dot.

(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) I’m assuming you have a plan?

(PCPG) You’re not gonna like it.
 
(Tom, 4, smittenMAX) I didn’t like the previous ones, but me being miserable hasn’t stopped your madness from working so far.
 
(PCPG) That’s… reassuring. Anyways, I was thinking of utilizing your time as a professor in the marketing strategy. How much more qualified could one possibly be?
 
(Tom, 1, angryMIN) Oh absolutely not.
 
(PCPG) Why? This not being public knowledge is an insane amount of potential wasted!
 
(Tom, 2, angryMAX) Yeah, but I wasn’t proud of it while it lasted and I’m not proud of it now. I won’t let Azumi be tied to this, because now, finally, I actually care.
 
(PCPG) They don’t give a shit about what you taught, it’s just about the prestige of the professor title, that’s all.
 
(Tom, 2, angryMIN) It would still taint the entire project. I don’t fucking care if people know about the pony shit.

(Tom, 2, confusedMAX) All the teachers know and I told you pretty freely, but it can’t be the reason why I get elected, it can’t be why Azumi gets the audience she deserves.
 
(PCPG) But if you won’t allow it on principle…
 
(Tom, 1, confusedMAX) Look, I know that having principles reduces my chance of success. That’s obvious. But if I don’t fucking stand for anything at all, then my art is worthless.

(Tom, 1, sadMIN) Just more mindless, crowd-pleasing bullshit and that’s the worst thing I can imagine.
 
(PCPG) Okay, I’ll try to think of something, but I’m still your campaign manager.
 
(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) I hope you make the right choice.

His position is clear, but I can’t just let him leave. We’ve got some support going, sure, but not enough to win this, so what the fuck am I supposed to do? 

Let him pack his shit and drive away forever when I haven’t even told the stubborn fuck that I love him? Fat chance! 

Maybe I just have to do what’s best for him, even if he doesn’t see it that way. It’s worked so far, by his own admission. God no, he’ll hate me!

(9/11, standin) Buddy, I’ve been used and abused by presidential candidates like you wouldn’t even believe, but this is a new fucking low.

(9/11, concern) Being a co-founder of this place and then going all “tear down the system” when it doesn’t work out for him anymore? How is America supposed to trust this guy?

(PCPG) Apart from the deeply worrying implications of everything you just said; how does his past prevent him from doing any of this?

If he is mad, it’s certainly not showing. Well, aside from the “sitting in his car ready to drive away forever” thing, but what I mean is that it’s not showing on his face. 

Tom looks more resigned than anything else.
 
(PCPG) Is there nothing I can do to make you stay?

(Tom, 3, shockedMIN) You know, I kinda regret throwing away that win.
 
(PCPG) What do you mean?
 
(Tom, 3, sadMIN) Ten Paces And Draw… Maybe I would have lost anyways, but there could have been a chance.
 
(PCPG) You made the right choice, why does it bother you now?
 
(Tom, 2, shockedMIN) I told you that I put Azumi on Newgrounds, right?

(Tom, 1, confusedMIN) Well guess whom the “game of the month” title got snubbed from last second by some big tits fanservice game.
 
(PCPG) Well that sucks, but it’s still second place.
 
(Tom, 1, sadMIN) Yeah, and second place is great, for sure, but a win would have been nice. I guess I’m just tired of losing to cute anime girls.
 
(PCPG) Are you drawing a parallel to Mage and Endless War here? Because that’s really reaching.
 
(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Maybe? It definitely feels like I’m giving up in the final round again.
 
(PCPG) You haven’t lost yet. There’s still time before the vote.
 
(Tom, 2, confusedMIN) It’s in two days.
 
(PCPG) That’s more than enough time. You know, I think we have been going about this the wrong way.

(PCPG) These stunts are nice and all, but we never really tried to market you on the basis of what you actually make. We need to show them Azumi.
 
(Tom, 1, smittenMIN) And how are we supposed to do that?
 
(PCPG) Do you still have that facemask?

Despite the overwhelming abundance of such scenes in entertainment media, this was the first time in my life that I found myself crawling through an air vent. 

Also despite the overwhelming abundance of such scenes, I was utterly unprepared when it gave in to our weight and dropped me and Tom onto the floor of the exact room we were trying to get to.

(Azumi|???, Campus, smittenMAX)
 
(PCPG) What did you say?
 
(Azumi|???, Campus, happyMIN) I asked if you were alright?
 
(PCPG) I guess… my head just hurts a little. How did I get here, wherever it is, and who are you?
 
(Azumi|???, Campus, neutral) We’re in modern-day feudal Japan, obviously, and my name would be Azumi.
 
(PCPG) Modern-day Japan isn’t feudal… why would you even specify the time period?
 
(Azumi, Campus, confusedMAX) How could I be a ninja if it weren’t?
 
(PCPG) That is an excellent question, never fucking mind then.
 
Apart from being a ninja, Azumi also seems to be a one-armed raccoon lady, therefore establishing that everything I thought to know about reality is clearly wrong. 

I can’t even remember my own name for god’s sake.
 
(Azumi|Sword, Campus, angryMIN) Just let me drink this useless fuck’s blood already, or at least leave him to die there!
 
Unlike Azumi, who speaks in a way that is almost uncannily anime and shows hints of an accent, this guy sounds gruff and thoroughly American. 

Feudal Japan must be quite multicultural nowadays.
 
(PCPG) Not to seem paranoid, cause there’s clearly no reason to be, but what does he mean by “drink my blood”?
 
(Azumi, Campus, sadMIN) Simply ignore him. He has an exceedingly one-track mind even by the standards of cursed swords.
 
(PCPG) Oh, so you guys have some kind of good cop/bad cop deal going on, got it.
 
(Azumi, Campus, confusedMIN) I have no idea what a “cop” is. A type of monster?
 
(PCPG) No, well it’s not really worth explaining. What I mean is that one of you takes care of intimidation while the other lulls the suspect into a false sense of security.
 
(Azumi, Campus, happyMAX|blushMIN) We don’t really do either of that… intimidation is kind of unnecessary when you can just kill things.
 
Lovely.
 
My facial expression might have come off as a little too judging, as Azumi feels the need to justify herself.
 
(Azumi, Campus, angryMAX) There are countless forces which seek to cause harm to the inhabitants of this land, both systemic and localized in the form of murderous monstrosities.

(Azumi, Campus, confusedMAX) Having to resort to solutions beyond the “magic of friendship” comes with the territory of living in a society.
 
(PCPG) Sooo you’re just running around slaying monsters and probably trying to exact revenge on whichever shady character took your arm, right?
 
(Azumi, Campus, angryMIN) Not for the arm, my jackass of a sword sliced that off to satiate his bloodthirst, but essentially.
 
Deeply disturbing as that may be, I have never been so close to having my childhood dream of becoming an outlaw ninja come true. 

I have to take this opportunity, not that I actually remember anything about my childhood, but come on, who wouldn’t have had that dream?/n A joyless philistine, that’s who.
 
(PCPG) You might want my help then, for you see; I was the most feared swordsman in all the land where I came from.
 
(Azumi|Sword, Campus, angryMIN) And where would that be, shitface?
 
(PCPG) Umm… Bosutan-chō!
 
(Azumi, Campus, confusedMIN) Bosu…tan?
 
(PCPG) Yes, It is a mysterious village unknown to the outside world, because… anyone who ever visited was killed by our excellent warriors.

(PCPG) Stabbing people has a long tradition in... Bosutan.
 
(Azumi|Sword, Campus, confusedMAX) …
 
(Azumi, Campus, confusedMIN) …

(Azumi|Sword, Campus, smittenMIN) Well fuck, his story checks out. Welcome on board, kid.
 
Hell fucking yes
 
(Azumi, Campus, neutral) We should get going then, the next wave is coming soon.

We retreat into a welcomingly furnished underground lair and Azumi changes into a more comfortable getup. The TV and PlayStation seem especially out of place. 

Upon closer inspection, I find that we are not alone. On the couch lurks a slimoidal entity, which I had at first mistakenly believed to be a pillow.

I jump backwards.

(Azumi, Casual, offright, slide, center, shockMAX)
 
(PCPG) Azumi, draw your sword, the enemy made it in here.
 
(Azumi, Casual, shockMIN) The enemy…?
 
Azumi looks confused
 
(Uwupedy) OwO You don’t mean wittle ol’ me, do you?
 
(PCPG) I did actually. I also kind of didn’t assume you could talk, so um…
 
I turn to Azumi.
 
(PCPG) …what’s his deal?
 
(Azumi, Casual, sadMIN) He’s a victim of the world’s cruelty, like all of us. A forsaken soul who studies the blade to right the wrongs of the system responsible for his suffering.
 
Her expression is grave, and I refrain from articulating doubts about bladed weaponry’s ability to solve ALL of society’s problems, let alone the ability of a slime to wield it.
 
(Uwupedy) Swimecowp twied to dissowve me in P.I.S.S., becauwse I wouldn’t wet my identity be dissowved by the mawaise of awienated wabour QwQ.
 
(Azumi|Sword, Casual, sadMAX) Awful fucking place.

(Azumi|Sword, Casual, sadMIN) Bitches bleedin’ slime when I detach their limbs from their fucking bodies. It’s messed up. I can’t drink fucking slime.
 
(Uwupedy) The Swime isn’t the pwobwem, the peopwe are.

(Uwupedy) But thanks to Azumi-sensei’s hewp, I’m stiww awive and I’ww be abwe to enact wighteous wengance against the cowpowate ewites of NLACakaNM UwU.
 
Azumi nods approvingly. In her eyes, there’s a shimmer of pride for her pupil, or maybe it’s hope. Hope for a brighter tomorrow, a future without rampaging beasts, bloodthirsty vermin and unregulated corporatism.

So this Is life as a ninja, huh?/n I sure could get used to it.
 
Azumi pulls a controller out from under the television and hands it to me.
 
(Azumi, Casual, happyMAX|blushMAX) Let’s kill some monsters.

Why the fuck would I even consider passing out in a moment like this? 

Why would one ever actively consider passing out for that matter? 

What a bafflingly retarded thought, I must have a concussion or something.
 
(Tom, 1, angryMAX) Where’s my fucking sword. Now that I’m doing the real ninja shit, I feel like I should have a sword.
 
(PCPG) We can take care of that next. Now make the announcement.

Tom staggers over to the desk and grabs the microphone labelled “For when the Dirvish starts a-whirlin’”. He makes sure it’s broadcasting, takes a deep breath, and exclaims:
 
(Tom, mic, shockedMIN) Fellow students, class is canceled, but if you ARE games and you want to play a sick ass action platformer made by yours truly; come to the computer lab to see the games you wanna be!
 
Before Tom even gets a chance to put down the microphone, the sound of thousands of footsteps fills the corridors.
 
(PCPG) Okay, let’s get out of here before Nate finds us. Do you know of any place safe?
 
(Tom, 4, neutral) The computer lab is gonna be too crowded for him to find us, it’s also a good chance to get some feedback.
 
(PCPG) Alright.

This is it, Radprom has arrived, and with it the announcement of the election results. This day also marks my last chance to tell Tom how I feel about him, or at least the last dramatic chance. 

A braver man would have confessed his love, lying side by side in the dust and rubble of a collapsed air vent, but alas I’m a little bitch. 

A little bitch in a dashing suit that is. 

God I hope we win this.

It’s easy to feel small and insignificant in the giant, beautifully decorated auditorium, and it’s even easier if it’s half empty because a large swath of the student population is in the computer lab playing Azumi and the Vertical Slice.

(Nate, Campus, Papers, Neutral) Hello puny students, before the festivities commence, let’s get the technicalities out of the way. By that, I of course mean the position of student council president, which unsurprisingly once more goes to…
 
Nate folds a small piece of paper open and pauses for a moment. 

The Auditorium is dead silent.
 
(Nate, Campus, Papers, ConfusedMAX) …Tom... Oliver… this can’t be right.
 
Without a moment of hesitation, we rush onto the stage.

[SLIDE, Nate, center, left]
 
(Tom, 1, happyMAX, offright, slide, center) I’m sorry, I haven’t really prepared a speech, which is like the lamest statement you could possibly start a speech with.

(Tom, 2, angryMIN) What kind of hack needs a stupid script to get their genuine thoughts across./n Just grab some wine and rant into a microphone like any other asshole!
 
We’re handed two glasses of champagne and Tom lifts his into the air.
 
(Tom, champagne, confusedMIN) This, once again, isn’t actual wine, but it’s the closest we’re gonna get, so fuck it…/n I still don’t really know why I’m here.

(Tom, champagne, confusedMAX) I actually wanted to leave this place weeks ago, but if I’ve learned anything, it’s that it’s not about skill; It’s about persistence and embracing your own stupidity.

(Tom, champagne, confusedMIN) Some people probably voted for me because I saved their favorite show. Some because they’re weird fucking communists, and others again because they liked my game, hopefully.

(Tom, champagne, smittenMAX) But that’s just the unimportant details and nobody really cares about that shit, because actually I do know what got me here, who inspired me to stay and try one more time.

(Tom, champagne, smittenMAX) He’s standing right here and he might actually have a speech prepared, because incomprehensible as it might be; this idiot actually believed in me.

(Tom, champagne, happyMAX) Give it up for PCPG.
 
(PCPG) I don’t think I can tell you what kind of person Tom Oliver is. Not because he’s some aloof douchebag, but because I’d be missing the point and you are too if you’re listening to this.

(PCPG) The people sitting in the computer lab are experiencing the truest representation of this lovable art polymath right now, and so should you, honestly.

(PCPG) Just fucking go there, you won’t regret it! Maybe you’ll see what true passion looks like and be inspired in the same way I was, because – and here goes nothing – I Love this man.

(PCPG) Capital L Love, and I’d repeat the bullshit that was the past few weeks any time!
 
(Tom, champagne, smittenMAX)

I turn toward Tom, fear swelling up inside me./n What have I done?/n I feel like I might pass out.

Then…

All the anxiety is washed away as his lips touch mine, the hairs of his mustache softly brush against my face. 

Some students cheer as the auditorium slowly empties. 

I want this moment to last forever.
