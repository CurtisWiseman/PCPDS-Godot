[Location: hallway2]

With the tap of a finger, I add the entirety of Yu Yu Hakusho to my anime list, making it slightly less pathetic in the process. 

Some part of me wonders whether the tremendous spike in my consumption of Japanese media over the past few days is purely a result of wanting to impress Professor Digibro, 

while another wonders how long it’s gonna take for me to fully admit that I’m gay as hell for anime Jesus.

Or straight as hell.

Who cares?

Turning a corner, I barely avoid the established hazard of school hallways, that are bump-into-girl-panty-shot-CGs, immediately followed by varying amounts of physical violence.

(Endless War, knife, angryMIN, offleft, slide, center) Watch where you’re going, juvie!
 
The amount in this case would likely be either tsundere bullshit or a fucking knife in my abdomen, 

or both.
 
(PCPG) Yeah, sorry. I’m sort of in a hurry to get to Japanese class.
 
(Endless War, knife, confusedMED) Class starts in ten minutes, nark. Your delinquency skills could really use some work.
 
(PCPG) Aren’t you in the student council?
 
(Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Really? That’s your comeback? They called it organized crime last time I checked.

(Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Now get to your shitty weeb course already. I can’t be seen consorting with juvie lowlifes like you.
 
A quick glance at my phone reveals that I still have time to get the pre-lecture rant that has become a part of my morning routine. 

[SLIDE, EndlessWar, offright]

While something about coming to school and returning fifteen bucks poorer without having eaten anything reminds me of middle school, 

those unpleasant memories are easily outweighed by the joy of hearing the professors soothing voice.

[Screen shake]

I slam my fifteen Yang-bucks onto the desk with a little more force than strictly necessary.
 
(PCPG) Hey Digi, what do you want out of life, romantic or otherwise? Goals, plans, machiavellian schemes, whatever comes to mind.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, HappyMED) Well, as the people who’ve been around for a while surely know, I was one of the founders of this place, and my ethos is kind of the same as it was back then, 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, HappyMED) which is that the main point of generating income is to support the creative ventures of anyone who has something to offer.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, Neutral) This is essentially a front, 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, Neutral) like sure, we disseminate information and relate it to students in a manner that is more digestible than the impenetrable vortex of human knowledge we got it from, 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, Neutral) which IS what universities are for, I guess, but that’s not the main point.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, Neutral) There are more effective ways of telling people facts…
 
There’s something mesmerizing about the way his scraggly beard moves as he talks. 

I find myself pondering titles for the preposterous light novel that my life has become. 

“I fell in love with my teacher, but I’m the mysterious transfer student and have to catch up on decades of Japanese subculture to win his affection…”
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, HappyMIN) …In terms of relationships, I definitely want to settle down at some point, and since I’m acutely obsessed with being understood, 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, HappyMIN) which is kind of why I even do this in the first place, the only person I could spend all my time with is someone who is essentially me.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, SmittenMIN) Some girl has started talking to me on social media recently, and that’s kind of promising…
 
Wait, what? 

Girl? 

Fuck!
 
(PCPG) Who?

(PCPG) What social media? 

(PCPG) You have to listen to me, she…
 
The bell rings
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, HappyMAX) Well, that’s that for this rant./n
Thanks for your contribution to the Digibro-niche-art-foundation.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 3, HappyMED) Take a seat, class is on.
 
I want to protest, but do as I am told since I don’t actually have any kind of persuasive argument in favor of immediately breaking off contact with this devious e-girl.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, AngryMIN) So, the Davoo had some of his own stuff to do, so we don’t have a PowerPoint presentation for today.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, Neutral) Which is just as well, since I wanted to try out a test I’ve been thinking about anyways.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, Neutral) Here’s a list of some anime. I want you to write about whether or not you like each one, and what specifically you enjoy about them.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, Neutral) This should take like an hour and a half. You can talk if you want to.
 
(PCPG) Wait, we can talk during the test?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, ShockMIN) Sure, I don’t really know why you would want to write down someone else’s opinion. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, ShockMIN) Who are you? Arkada?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMED) Just don’t talk to me, I want to try to get some writing done.
 
With that, he opens up his laptop and starts typing, leaving the classroom in confused, though fleeting silence.
 
(Davoo, Campus, Greeting, ShockMAX, offleft, slide, left) One and a half hours?! That’s not enough time to write a proper friggin thesis on any one of these…
 
I only really hear the start of Davoo’s complaint.

[SLIDE, Davoo, offleft]

This is it. This is my chance to prove myself.

A project so supermassive as to catapult me into that exclusive group of people, whose opinions on anime Digibro respects. And so I start writing.

[Davoo leaves]

…

……

………
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, ConfusedMIN) Okay, hand in your essays./n
Let’s see who’s a pleeb and who’s a weeb!
 
The grading process is unusually quick, with Digi often just reading the first few lines of text before scribbling something onto the paper and placing it onto another pile. 

Impotent screams that he should at least consider the first three paragraphs before forming an opinion emanate from all over the classroom,/n
but they fall on deaf ears. 

Occasionally the professor erupts into profanity-laden soliloquies.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, AngryMED) This isn’t even a hot take! Who the fuck disagrees with this?!
 
Needless to say, the mood is tense.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, HappyMIN) Here you go, PCPG./n
I could have done with a bit less purple prose, but there were some interesting points in there

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, AngryMED) And at least you didn’t drone on and on about how you don’t typically care about x-type of show like most of these Geoff Thewian Fucktards.
 
I smile, take back my Light-Novel-length stack of manic ravings, hoping for A-tier and…

MOTHERFUCKER! 3/7?! 

Three out of fucking seven. 

Even glancing over the fact of what an absolutely laughable style of rating x/7 is; what in the ever-loving fuck did these assholes write?!

[SLIDE, Digi, right]

[StopMusic]

I turn to ask Davoo to see what he got, but Digi’s personal assistant seems to have already left somewhere.

[Song: PCPDating_Misato]

(Colt Corona, Thisvideo, shockMED, offleft, slide, left) AAAaaaaaAAAAaaAAAAAAaa

(Colt Corona, Thisvideo, AngryMED) He put numbers over the spot where I wanted to stick my giant horsey weiner AAAaaaa

(Colt Corona, Thisvideo, SadMIN) What did I do to deserve such cruelty?!
 
While the altered beast lewdly gestures at his crotch, I sneak a peak at his “essay”, which turns out to just be an incredibly crude drawing Pinkie Pie, 

along with a heart and the words “pony slut”.
 
Apparently, this piece of high art was deserving of a 7/7.

(Colt Corona, Thisvideo, SadMIN, slide, offleft) God has forsaken uuuuuus!

I leave for home devastated and with a rotten feeling in the depths of my stomach.

The bastion of academia looming above the city is easy to spot, despite the only source of light being an enormous, illuminated billboard on the other side of the street. 

The positioning seems almost spiteful seeing how it advertises another University./n
The text on it reads:

“What’s in an OP?/n
Does SAO still suck?

How long will the sponsorship segment be?/n
Find out at the Thewniversity!

after this ad for Naruto online”
 
The twenty-minute tutorial I watched on lockpicking proves useless as the door to PCPU simply swings open.
 
[Location: hallway2]
 
Strangely enough, there still seems to be a light burning in the Japanese classroom./n
More specifically, it looks like the blue glow of a monitor. 

There can’t still be anyone here this late at night, they probably just forgot to turn it off, right? 

Besides, I can’t turn back now./n
It’s time to get action and steal some test-answers, baby.

(PCPG) N-No. What are you doing here?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, ShockMIN) Writing, producing content the only way I know how:/n
by being a workaholic insomniac.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ConfusedMIN) I also feel like I’m in a better position to ask you that question.
 
[Choice]

*Tell the truth*
*Make something up*
 
*Tell the truth*

(PCPG) Okay, this probably sounds really fucking stupid, but I had to find out what makes my taste so shit as to be deserving of a 3/7, so I made a plan to steal the answer sheets.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, AngryMIN) Well fuck you, I am a 3/7./n
I call myself an autist all the fucking time, it’s not a fucking insult.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, AngryMED) Also seeing how you’re in a fucking course on anime, you better come to terms with being on the spectrum.
 
I’m completely lost.
 
(PCPG) What?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, ConfusedMIN) How did you even get the idea that I had answer-sheets?
 
(PCPG) How can you only get 3/7 when you made the test?

(PCPG) This doesn’t make any fucking sense.

(PCPG) How does your shitty scale work and what does it have to do with autism?!
*
 
*Make something up*

(PCPG) I -uh- forgot my pencil here, so I wanted to get it before class starts.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ConfusedMIN) Six hours before class starts?
 
(PCPG) Yeah, well, you know. That test kind of messed with my head./n
I’ve been thinking about it all day.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, ShockMIN) Well yeah, that’s the point; to contemplate on it and play with the concept a little.
 
(PCPG) Right, but I put a lot of soul into that analysis, just to get 3/7?

(PCPG) I’m not saying I’m an amazing writer, but that’s lower mid-tier./n
That’s “The Anime Man”-territory.

(PCPG) I really respect the work you’re doing, and I probably deserved the score I got, but it still stings quite a bit.

[Song: PCPDating_ClassJapanese]

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, ShockMED) Wait, you thought I was rating the quality of your writing?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 3, HappyMAX) It’s a fucking autism score according to the Media-Neurodivergence-Scale./n
I explained this after handing out the results!
 
(PCPG) I might not have heard that over the psychotic breakdown I was having.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, Neutral) Well, now that that’s cleared up, want a beer?

(PCPG) Sure.

Digi passes me a can he produces from under his desk.

(PCPG) Oh, I've seen this stuff on the shelves before, never had one tho.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, HappyMED) Fuck, you're missing out then!/n
Come on, take a swig and rate it!

(PCPG) You want me to review this Tacate?/n
Will it affect my autism score?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, HappyMIN) Nah, but it might change my opinion of you depending on what you think.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, SmittenMAX) Now drink already ya punk bitch.

He raises his own can and toasts me.

(PCPG) alright then

[Choice]

*It's good*
*It could be more sophisticated*

*It's good*

Oh god, this shit is really easy to drink./n
It simply flows down your throat without being watery or boring. 

It just tastes like beer,/n
damn good beer. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ShockMIN) So, whatcha think

(PCPG) I can only imagine how dangerous this stuff is in combination with a couch and something to watch.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 4, HappyMAX) Hell yeah, that's Tacate for you.

He throws me another can.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, ConfusedMAX) Huh, seems like that's the last one.
*

*It could be more sophisticated*

He seems like the kind of guy who would appreciate some snobby pretentious bullshit,/n
so let's give it to him. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ShockMIN) so, whatcha think.

(PCPG) It's okay I guess, but the flavor profile could really be more interesting.

(PCPG) It's missing a certain degree of abrasive hoppiness that characterizes truly great ales.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, AngryMIN)

Digi shoots me a look that every child could interpret as "oh, you're one of those people." 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, AngryMED) Sadly, I'm out of arrogant Bastards 

He pulls out another can and cracks it open in a practiced motion. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, Neutral) Well, this is the last can anyways
*

(PCPG) How many of these have you had?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, ConfusedMIN) About half a case

He shrugs.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, HappyMIN) Gets me in the mood./n
Gets my creative juices flowing. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, HappyMIN) That's the best reason to drink if you ask me!

(PCPG) Um, if I might ask; what's the project?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 3, HappyMAX) I'm writing a fucking light novel in a day baby!

As he says this, Digi slams his laptop shut and puts it in a bag. 

(PCPG) Wait, are you done? With the novel?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, SmittenMIN) Well no, but I'm fresh out of booze, sooo I'll go see a friend of mine./n
Do you want to tag along?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 4, HappyMin) PCPG, meet Dr. Cider./n
Cider, this is PCPG.

(PCPG) Doctor?

(Cider) PhD still pending ...

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, Neutral) And it has been for years./n
He’s the best bartender around though. 

(PCPG) When you said you were going to see a friend; I was kind of assuming…/n
at their home?

(PCPG) I wasn’t expecting to be taken on some kind of pub-crawl.

(Cider) What is a home really?

(Cider) It’s the place where you wake up in the morning with little recollection of the previous days./n
And I for one like having some ale nearby in those instances.

Before I can properly respond to the strangely inspirational musings of an alcoholic bartender, there’s a crash outside.

(Cider) Ay, first one of the day and it’s…

He looks at his watch.

(Cider) 3:30, somebody owes me twenty bucks.

(PCPG) Shouldn’t we check if they’re alright?

(Cider) Would’ve come in here covered in blood already if they survived./n
The road outside here is a deathtrap.

I look over to Digi to get some hits as to whether that was a joke or not.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, SadMIN) You can check on the corpse if you want to, but it’s gonna sour your buzz.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, HappyMIN) Don’t worry, he tries to keep the death toll to a minimum inside of the bar./n
I’ll have a Kir Royale.

Fuck I don’t know shit about drinks. 

Let’s say uhhh…

(PCPG) What’s a “Trevor’s brass monkey”?

(Cider) A brass monkey done hideously wrong./n
Just a giant fucking mistake in a glass. A… 

(Cider) I know exactly what to make you.

(Cider) Wait a second.

Cider hands me a glass of neon green liquid exuding the aura of something made for any purpose beside human consumption.

(PCPG) So what is it?

(Cider) This, my friend, is a drunken mistake./n
Cheers!

Digi retrieves the laptop from his bag and stats typing again.

(PCPG) And why exactly are you writing a light novel?/n
Don’t get me wrong, it’s cool and all, but most of these things kind of suck.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, ShockMIN) Most/n
yeah, sure.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, AngryMED) But that’s not a problem with the format./n
It’s a problem with lazy uninspired hacks.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, AngryMED) So the same as with all things.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, Neutral) The point is mainly to prove that I can write fiction that is at least palatable 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, Neutral) along with the standard self-indulgence which lies at the core of all writing.

(PCPG) Okay, I get that/n
But why does it have to be in a day?

(PCPG) That does sound kind of hacky.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, AngryMED) Because that asshole from Eromanga allegedly did it.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, HappyMIN) It’s not like I won’t edit it later or take longer for later volumes,/n
but there has to be some semi-finished thing at the end of the day. I’m nearing the final stretch anyway.

Digi’s stomach growls, and I also feel some amount of hunger set in.

[Choice]

*Stay at the bar*
*Get something to eat*

*Stay at the bar*

(PCPG) Well, whatever this slime-looking stuff is, I’ll take another round of it!

(Cider|Cider) You sure?/n
It’s called the drunken mistake for a reason, you know.

(Cider|Cider) Makes ya feel like your brain’s dissolving.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ConfusedMIN) Since when do you try to stop people from drinking?/n
Isn’t that your main source of entertainment?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ConfusedMIN) I’ll take one as well.

Digi seems like he’s also still too drunk to properly process anything. Instead he just looks down at his laptop.

I look over at his screen, the word document is empty.

(PCPG) It’s…

It’s good./n
It’s certainly not bad, but after how much Digi hyped this place up, it’s definitely a bit disappointing. 

I wonder if the professor’s alone in his unfaltering adoration for the food here and his other friends had a similar experience.

(PCPG) It’s the best meal I have ever had in my life.

(PCPG) Admittedly, I’ve mostly had cup ramen and my own shitty attempts at poor boy cooking, but Wow this must be what drugs feel like./n
I think I can die now.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 5, SmittenMAX) “What drugs feel like”?/n
You go to fucking PCPU, how have you never smoked weed?

Maybe I’ll try some of the strains the cafeteria inexplicably serves.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ConfusedMED) Don’t./n
That stuff sucks dick.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, ConfusedMED) Although I’m kind of short on supply myself.

(PCPG) So what, are you like a big weed guy?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 1, ShockMIN) Probably depends on what metric you use, but yeah, I’m pretty into it./n
Or at least enough into it to get seriously annoyed by the piss poor availability.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Casual, 2, HappyMIN) The whole idea of manually altering your brain chemistry is just fascinating to me.

What are you typing then?

(Digi|Digi, Casual, 5, SmittenMIN) So we’ve been chatting on social media./n
Her name’s May and…

Oh god this is bad. He’s still talking to her./n

She’s probably a cosplayer.

*Save him from social media*
*Save him from the government*

In a motion so lacking in terms of swiftness, that only someone similarly drunk could fail to react to it, I snatch the phone out of his hand

And break it in half.

(PCPG) You also have shittons of notebooks, so I’m sure you won’t run out of ideas.

I sloppily break his grasp of the phone and plunge the cursed piece of tech into my beer glass.

(Digi|Digi, Casual, 5, ShockMAX) Why did you do that?!

(PCPG) So, you know how all social media platforms are controlled by a cabal of rich oligarchs bending the socio-political climate to their whims?

(Digi|Digi, Casual, 2, ConfusedMIN) Have I told you to check out encyclopedia.zone?

(PCPG) Maybe?/n
What I’m getting at is, that these guys are trying to brainwash anime reviewers in order to help them orchestrate a weeb uprising to justify their retaliation.

(PCPG) These people killed Jeffrey Epstein, so no one is safe, especially not you./n
It was for the greater good.

(PCPG) Digi, get down, quick!

(Digi|Digi, Casual, Crouch)

As the prof ducks under the table./n
I throw his phone out of the window.

(Digi|Digi, Casual, Crouch) What happened?

(PCPG) Some guy with a katana came sprinting toward our desk and yelled something along the lines of “Hey, that’s the contrarian asshole who made like five billion videos incessantly shitting on the asterisk war.”

(Digi|Digi, Casual, 2, ConfusedMIN) I didn’t hear any yelling

(PCPG) Well, maybe he didn’t “yell” exactly, but he seemed intense is what I’m getting at.

(PCPG) He probably got spooked when I saw him and warned you, so he just stole your phone and ran.

(Digi|Digi, Casual, 3, AngryMAX) Some fuck with a katana stole my phone?/n
This better not be used in the new batch of Digibro-exposed videos.

(Digi|Digi, Casual, 2, Neutral) Anyways, we should probably head to PCPU./n

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) …and of course, corporate funded science has nothing better to do than indulge the vanity of capital, even when there are multiple global crisis to be averted. 

So, we’ve got this shit.

Ben gestures toward a small flask on his desk.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, shockMIN) What did all of this research money go into you ask?

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, neutral) Well I’m gonna tell you: It literally turns you into an anime girl.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, angryMIN) It was pitched as some kind of rejuvenation elixir, which is obviously an affront to god, because anyone who reaches their thirties and isn’t thoroughly ambivalent toward their own existence needs to fucking grow up already.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, shockMIN) But also it’s made from slime, so of course it has weird side effects.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, shockMIN) I’m not saying that slime is bad, because only a complete troglodyte would believe that.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) I just think that Slimecorp might accidentally or purposefully kill us all if they keep fucking with stuff they cannot comprehend.

Digi’s been kind of distant ever since the Cauckcast encounter.

Maybe he’s just trying to revert back to a reasonable student-teacher relationship that doesn’t include after school drug deals, 

but it definitely seems like something changed after that fateful day. 

I’ve been keeping tabs on him, of course. So at least I know that he’s not dating May or anything. 

He…

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 4, HappyMIN, offright, slide, center) Hey, it’s been a while.

(PCPG) And who’s fault is that?/n
You’ve barely even given any lectures.

(PCPG) Your students are used to three hours of Digibro daily. They’re essentially in withdrawal.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, ConfusedMED) You’re exaggerating.

(PCPG) I’m not though./n
Some of them have resorted to actually watching anime, now that they have nothing to fill their time with anymore.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, AngryMED) Tough luck. These fucks are always clambering for bigger projects, and when you try to deliver, they complain that there’s a drought of good old fashioned ranting.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, AngryMIN) I’m already filling all my time with work. I don’t have any more to fill.

(PCPG) Don’t shoot the messenger, dude, I’m just relaying information.

(PCPG) How are you anyways?/n
It almost felt like you were avoiding me.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, SadMIN) I-/n
I’ve been busy.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, ConfusedMED) I’d love to talk about all the bullshit that’s been going on, but you’re already kind of more caught up in it than you should be.

(PCPG) You’re making it sound like the entire school is at risk, but if you can’t discuss it, I get that./n
Nice work getting your light novel into the library this quickly.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, HappyMED) There are certain privileges that come with being cofounder of this place…/n
Have you read it?

(PCPG) Of course I have. It’s definitely interesting to see you write fiction… but

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, ConfusedMIN) But?

(PCPG) No, it’s not a criticism. I’ve just been wondering… these characters… they’re the ones from the posters in your classroom, right?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 4, SmittenMIN) Yeah, that’s one of the other benefits; students just draw your characters for you, and you don’t even have to pay them.

The air in the library has that strange property air sometimes acquires when conversations fail to contain what needs to be said, but progress anyway./n
It feels heavy. 

Crushingly heavy, viscous and pregnant with words that could be spoken.

All that it takes is to break the deadlock.

(PCPG) It kind of feels like no time has passed at all since we met up here, you know./n
Since you recommended Boogiepop to me.

(PCPG) I’ve read the rest since then, and the more time I spent with you, the more I realized how much of it is essentially a guide to understanding Digibro.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, ShockMED) Wait, you read all of it?

(PCPG) Ha ha, yeah./n
It was sort of a chore even just finding all of them.

(PCPG) Not that they aren’t good. They’re great and I love them, but there are needlessly many and it’s stupidly hard to find decent fan translations.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, ConfusedMIN) Including the spin-offs and short stories?

(PCPG) There are spin-offs?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, HappyMIN) Don’t worry about it. Fuck knows I haven’t read all of Boogiepop.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, HappyMAX) What are your thoughts though?/n
I hope you have a loving thesis prepared.

(PCPG) Um… I can see how it informs your perspective on… well… individual perspective. The reader learns about the events that transpired through these narrators with incomplete information, but it’s not just a stylistic flourish. There could just as easily be one character who investigated after the fact and found the whole truth as the narrator, but it wouldn’t really be the truth. While it’s not necessarily that distorted, it’s just facts rather than the story. An essential aspect of the events is their absurdity, and absurdity is lost when it is fully understood. The real intrigue comes from how these different characters disseminate information and integrate it into their worldviews. Boogiepop draws a direct parallel to its examination of the neurologically atypical. For abnormality to mean anything, it must be looked at from the inside, because a third person narrator will always conflate the ability to function with normalcy, which is the exact reductionist attitude that becomes a problem. In a way, it could be seen as a mystery novel, which treats its mystery the way a drama would, in that understanding the “what” isn’t really the goal, but rather understanding how these people deal with that which they know. A singular truth can only ever be unjustifiably truncated, and a perspective cannot ever encompass the whole truth. Only a plurality of incomplete perspectives…

(PCPG) ...or at least I think that’s what It’s supposed to mean?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, AngryMIN) Dude, just record a fucking youtube video.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, SmittenMIN) But yeah, I can see how you would take that away from it./n
I’ve read these books so many goddamn times, I could probably tell their story verbatim.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, SmittenMIN) Sometimes your mind just resonates with a certain piece of media so much that it’s hard to even deal with; it seeds so many new thoughts that the outside world loses relevance for a while.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, HappyMAX) You’re at your limit, about to overflow, thinking any more is impossible.

(PCPG) Pretty sure that’s normal? Just rare./n
A kind of experience so potent you only get to have it a few times, especially when you’re young.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, HappyMIN) I was a kid, and my relation to the outside world was strained at best anyways.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, AngryMED) Small, long hair, awkward as shit and reading light novels before anyone even knew what that was in the U.S.

(PCPG) Can’t have been easy

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, SmittenMIN) It wasn’t, but it’s also the kind of situation in which a story explicitly about not fitting in would resonate with you that strongly.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, SmittenMIN) Not that I fit in now, but I’ve gotten better at using that and dealing with it… To a point where I’m even kind of okay with my body now.

(PCPG) Your body?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, ConfusedMAX) Oh god, that sounds like the gayest thing in the universe.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, SadMIN) Well, you grow up being called a girl and hating it, and then, when puberty strikes, and you start looking… Still hella weird, but no longer girly, just like a deranged asshole.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, SadMED) You look into the mirror and think to yourself: Well fuck, maybe I would have liked being a girl, now that that choice is essentially gone.

(PCPG) Sorry, how does Boogiepop fit into that exactly?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, SmittenMIN) It’s about a clearly male and a clearly female entity, both using a body which… Like, it is the body of a girl but that doesn’t really matter to anyone.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 3, SmittenMAX) I can be a fucking alicorn princess and anyone who tells me I can’t be because I look like a clusterpunk hobo can eat a dick./n
You really didn’t get that from reading Boogiepop?

(PCPG) I guess I’ve never really thought of myself as a gendered entity in the first place. Not in a shitty “I don’t feel like someone of a certain gender, I just act the role and it doesn’t bother me”-way.

(PCPG) I more mean that it feels like the entire concept of gender doesn’t apply to me on a metatextual level.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, HappyMED) That sure is a take.

(PCPG) A good one?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, HappyMED) Eh, I can appreciate it.

(PCPG) Well, if you’re still at all interested in being an anime girl, I think I might have something for you.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, ConfusedMIN) Anyone who says they wouldn’t be interested in that is plainly lying to themselves, but there’s no way something like that is possible.

(PCPG) You don’t know a lot about Slimecorp, huh?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, ConfusedMED) I try to stay out of the endless war. It’s way too fucking complicated and all of the killing sound like a huge time sink.

(PCPG) Well, they made an experimental elixir to do exactly that, and I think I know how we can get our hands on it.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, ShockMIN) Who are you? You’ve only been here in Boston for a few weeks, so how do you have all these contacts?

(PCPG) It’s less of a contact and more of a thing which is at this school and which we could steal ...

(PCPG) I’m not some kind of plant it that’s what you’re asking./n
Who would I even be a plant for?

(PCPG) ...Well, you are….

(PCPG)  I’ll call Professor Saint.

(PCPG) Yo, Ben. Funny thing; Digi accidentally drank the anime girl juice… Wait, no. The slimecorp-rejuvenation whatever the fuck, and nothing is visibly happening…

(PCPG) ...How bad is that?

(Ben|Professor Saint) What?!

(Ben|Professor Saint) That bottle was just for show, we can’t afford the real stuff!

(PCPG) So what is it?

(Ben|Professor Saint) Some cheap knockoff I got off of the black market, which is kind of the only market, but whatever.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 4, ConfusedMIN) Snob? I thought you died or some shit.

He knows this guy?

(Snob|That Anime Snob, snob, smug) Unsurprising that you’re too busy indulging in the sound of your own voice for hours on end without getting to the point to know who’s on your own janitorial staff.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 3, AngryMIN) Have you been around this place?/n
It doesn’t even fucking look like it fucking has any cleaning personnel, let alone a whole staff.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 3, ConfusedMIN) What are you really here for?

(Snob|That Anime Snob, snob, neutral) I’m not here for anything. This school is a disgrace. You fill the heads of these children with your shit taste and lies about modern anime being “good”.

(PCPG) What about something like Doukyuusei? That was great.

(Snob|That Anime Snob, snob, smug) It was mediocre slice-of-nothing-ever-fucking-happens, you pleb.

(Snob|That Anime Snob, snob, smug) How can you listen to someone who wears sunglasses indoors and take him seriously?

(PCPG) Don’t make fun of the shades, man./n
So uncool.

(Snob|That Anime Snob, snob, smug) Ha! The Hypocrisy!

(PCPG) That’s not what hypocri… Digi, who is this old fuck? I can barely understand him.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, AngryMED) Someone who’s seen a bunch of shit and thinks that’s enough qualification to do analysis, despite being a complete incompetent moron, who thinks that a point which can be made in a minute isn’t too shallow to even be worth making. But most of all…

The janitor’s intrusion had kind of distracted me from the whole elixir-incident, but something in definitely wrong with Digi. 

His hands crackle with a strange kind of magical energy and his aura has changed in a way I can’t really describe. Suddenly, the realization I should have had minutes ago strikes; 

He is a magical girl in all aspects except physical!

(Snob|That Anime Snob, snob, smug)

In all my life of blatant disregard for the law and basic social conduct, I never once assumed that I might go to jail.

The justice system seemed very keen on getting rid of Digi, as though someone much more powerful was pulling the strings. 

The world is full of fuck. Random Isekaiing, Snob, there has to be something going on behind the scenes, 

my options of doing anything against it while locked up are limited though.

(Tom, 2, happyMIN) Well, no one beside me is truly games enough to be here… also I guess Digi sometimes.

(Tom, 1, confusedMIN) So are you gonna tell me what happened?

(PCPG) We killed a shitty Greek anime guy and needed somewhere to hide. Oh, and Digi may just have magical girl powers now. That’s a thing, probably, I guess.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, SadMIN) I’m not sure if I like the mechanic. It sort of gets rid of the need to, you know, plan ahead.

(Tom, 4, neutral) Yeah, I can see that. Speaking of; what do you think of the new Pokémon?

(PCPG) Did you listen to me? Someone died. Is this really the time to discuss video games?

It takes a few moments for my brain to realize that I am no longer at PCPU and that the rift must have enveloped us. It takes a few more to figure out what exactly this place is.

For a moment, I see stars blink and a giant robot with cool fucking shades zoom through the vastness of space.

(PCPG) What’s he doing this for anyways? Doesn’t he have his own vastly more successful school and shit?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, ConfusedMIN) Have you ever wondered why this entire city is practically crawling with self-proclaimed anime experts and yet PCPU only has two of them?

(PCPG) I was assuming you couldn’t afford any more.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, AngryMED) No, the reason is that I actually care about the quality of the discourse and call these hacks out for what they are.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 5, AngryMED) They’ve been trying to get rid of me for ages, but apparently they’ve found a decent weapon now.

[Location: insidemech.geoff]

(Geoff) Black market magical girl elixir; Hard to get your hands on, but channels open up if you make the right endorsements. 

(Geoff) We can chase you through the entire realm of anime with this power!

(Geoff) Four against one. This really is the kind of might befitting of an OP-expert.

(PCPG) I’ll look past the fact that you didn’t even count me as an entity here, but why exactly didn’t you just drink it yourself? That’s a bit overly convoluted.

(Geoff) Obviously this stuff doesn’t work on men./n
You need the soul of an anime girl for the potion to take effect.

(PCPG) You still have those, right?

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, ConfusedMIN) I think so? But May can just do the same thing as me.

(PCPG) Sure, but it’s not about May. She just wants you, so it’s Geoff we really need to worry about.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 1, ConfusedMAX) Okay, and your point is…?

(PCPG) You can open a rift back and take May with you. I’ll continue piloting the mech so they don’t suspect anything and while Geoff is distracted you can seal the rift from the outside.

(Digi|Digi, Campus, 2, ShockMED) Fuck no. You’ll be trapped here.

(Geoff) Caucks, why have you stopped firing?

(Michelle) Well, May’s not responding anymore and this whole otaku shit is really fucking degenerate, so I think we’ll just leave.

(Geoff) What?! You can’t do that!

(Michelle) What are you gonna do? Come out of your mother’s basement and tell us about Naruto online?

Shit, and here I almost managed to be positive about the state of affairs. 

He’ll be happy with May, right?/n
Isn’t that all that matters; That he’s happy in his world?
