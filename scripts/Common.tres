[Song: PCPDating_HomeMorning]

Wow. My first day at PCP University!

My last school threw me out for being too retarded and not being able to finish my assignments.
 
Will this place be any better? Who knows, I might finally find some friends or even...

Love?

[Location: waytoschool.nojesse]

A cool breeze greets me this morning, making me regret not bringing a jacket. It feels good though, full of new opportunities and fresh starts.

As I pass the entrance to a dinky alley, a slim guy with fluffy hair nearly walks straight into me.

(Gibbon|???, campus, handsup, shockMIN, offright, slide, center) Oh whoops, I didn't see you there. Are you on your way to school too?

'Too'? He’s a student then?

(Player) Yeah, PCP University. Do you go there?

(Gibbon, campus, grabby, happyMED) Well given how it’s the only school in the city, yeah. Oh uh, the name's Gibbontake by the way, but you can call me Gibbon, or just Gib, it’s all interchangeable really.

(Player) Well, nice to meet you Gibbon. I’m 

[Give player the option to name themselves]

[If the player inputs “Brad Garlinghouse”]

[fade to black]
You introduce yourself as Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of the American technology company Ripple, and explain to Gibbon that you have changed from your old ways of hacking into the school computers, and have come to the PCPU to reconcile and make friendships, maybe even find some love.

Surprisingly, Gibbon accepts this and tells you that the past is in the past, and offers to show you around the university. Everyone at the university also quickly manages to forgive you for your heinous actions, eager to see you in a new light.

Everyone but Professor Nate Bestman, who at first is extremely angry at you for betraying his trust, but eventually, during your time at the PCPU, even he finds himself forgiving you.
After gaining their trust you slowly become more and more associated with the university. From a mere student you become a student council member, to the student council president, to a part time teacher, to a full time teacher, until you finally become the de facto leader of the PCPU, which you then control to advertise your new cryptocurrency, Ripple XXXRP. This one goes to the stars.

Why hack your way into the PCPU when you can [i]become[/i] the PCPU?

[BRAD CRASTINATORS ENDING]

[placeholder]
(PCPG) I’m PCPG, but, uh, aren't you going the wrong way? I’m new to Boston, but I thought the university was... wait shit, maybe I was looking at the Newgle Maps app upside-down...

(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN) Well yeah, it [i]is[/i] over that way, if you wanna take the main roads, but I like this shortcut through the alleyways. 

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral) Actually, you wanna walk with me? I could show you around the neighbourhood and tell you about the school and stuff.

I fail to see how backtracking through the alleys is a shortcut, but this guy seems friendly enough, and I set out early on purpose. Eh, what's the harm?

(PCPG) Sure! We can get to know each other too. Maybe we're in some of the same classes! So, what do you study...?

[Gibbon leaves]
As we walk and talk and we both learn that we have the exact same class schedule for today, a pretty useful coincidence, so he offers to show me around campus.

Though I’m kinda worried we won't make it there without being mugged, this place definitely doesn’t seem safe. I swear I saw a disheveled man lurking in the shado-

[Location: waytoschool.jesse, fade]

Ah! There he is! What's he doing crouching over a manhole cover?

He screams desperately into the sewers.

(Jesse|???) DONATELLO! Come back to me! Come on dude!

(PCPG) Is... is that guy okay, Gibbon?

(Gibbon, campus, HandsUp, neutral, offleft, slide, left) Oh don't mind the Sewer Priest, he's always like that.

[SLIDE Gibbon offleft]
[Gibbon leaves]

I take Gibbon at his word and turn my attention away from the loud ‘Priest’. I can't help but feel sorry for him though, if this is normal. The government really should do something about the homeless.

As the alleyway opens back up, I see the silhouette of the University peeking out from behind the houses, etching its shape into the skyline.

We enter the building and I’m already overwhelmed. Gibbon seems to know where we’re going, but I just feel completely lost. Our first class was music, right?

Suddenly a powerful voice booms at us.

(Nate|???) Hello fellow students!

(Nate|???, campus, papers, happyMIN|shades, fade, center) Oh, I haven’t seen you around before. Are you a new student?

(PCPG) Yeah, this is my first day here. I’m PCPG.

(Nate|???, campus, papers, happyMIN|shades) Well in that case hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators University!

(Nate|???, campus, papers, happyMIN|shades) First up, just know that if you aren’t willing to put in the effort to succeed at this school, I WILL end you. So tell me...

The professor steps closer to me. All of a sudden his once captivating muscles become intimidating, and his voice shifts to a serious tone.

(Nate|???, campus, standing, angryMED|shades) Do you plan to excel at this university? As a teacher, I want to see all my students become the greatest version of themselves. And I will do everything in my power to see that through to the end.

Suddenly flashbacks run through my mind of my last school. I cannot help but remember all the unfinished homework assignments, all the failed tests...

(PCPG) Uhh... yeah...

(Nate|???, campus, papers, sadMIN|shades) You don’t sound so sure of yourself. Oh well, just know that if you fail to meet standards I will not hesitate to take action. I HAVE principles!

Great...

(Action Giraffe, gesture2, sad, offleft, slide, left)
A cool looking giraffe catches the teachers attention.

(Nate|???, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) Oh hey Action Giraffe, how’s it going?

(Action Giraffe, gesture1, happy, left) I have AIDS.

(Nate|???, campus, smoking, happyMED|shades) Yeah, it’s pretty inspirational that despite your disease, you still strive towards your dreams.

(Nate|???, campus, pointing, happyMED|shades) See PCPG? Be more like Action Giraffe here and realize your dreams to their fullest, no matter what. I won’t accept anything less.

[SLIDE Nate offright]
[Nate leaves]
(PCPG) Who was that?

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, grabby, happyMED, offright, slide, right) That was Professor Bestman, he teaches the Memes and Philosophy classes.

(PCPG) Huh, those sound like interesting classes. And the giraffe?

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, grabby, happyMED) That’s Action Giraffe. He’s just reaaaally cool.

Gib turns to Action Giraffe.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, handsup, neutral) Hey AG, what class you got first?

(Action Giraffe, gesture3, shock, left) I have AIDS.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, default, happyMED) Hey, what a coincidence! We all start the day with the same class.

(PCPG) Wait, is ‘AIDS’ a class? I thought we had Music...

We reach the music classroom and Gibbon and I find seats next to each other. A scruffy man enters the room, obviously drunk.

(Digi|???, Campus, 3, happyMAX, offright, slide, center) Heyyy everybody! Welcome to music class!

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 3, happyMAX) I’m Professor Digibro, and well, I have no plans for this lesson whatsoever, 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 3, happyMAX) but I guess you’re all here for the authentic After Dark experience, so LET’S GOOOOO!

The Professor takes an elongated swig of his beverage then slams it down on his desk.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, happyMAX) As you all know, I am one of the progenitors of the cyberpunk horrorcore rap genre. Can anyone here tell me what that means?

As is to be expected, no one was paying enough attention to raise their hand.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, angryMIN) Speak up, cowards! I’ll just call on someone. Let’s see...

Digibro scans the room tentatively.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, happyMIN) You, the cool looking one with the sunglasses.

(Action Giraffe, gesture2, shock, offleft, slide, left) I have AIDS.

Digibro rubs his chin, deep in thought.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, confusedMIN) Hmm... I guess that’s a pretty good way to describe my music.

[SLIDE ActionGiraffe offleft]

[ActionGiraffe leaves]
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, happyMIN) Anyway, I’ve listed my bandcamp in the course outline sheet, so I highly recommend y’all check it out.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, confusedMIN) Hopefully you’ve all heard of Sturgeon’s Revelation, but for those of you who remain uninformed, it states that 90 percent of everything is crap. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, confusedMIN) Luckily, I consider my music to be in that gifted 10 percent...

Professor Digibro went on and on for what felt like hours. Most of what he was saying didn’t even seem like it was about music. 

In fact, he mostly talked about anime soundtrack composers, youtube marketing and about being an autistic “Devilman.” I soon find my mind drifting off...

[fade to black]

(Professor Digibro) Hey! Hey you. New kid.

[cut from black]

I snap back to reality. Great. It’s my first day and I’m already zoning out in class.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, confusedMED) Are you getting any of this?

(PCPG) Yeah. Music and stuff right?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, happyMAX) Good. There’s gonna be a quiz on all that stuff I just told you next Friday. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, happyMAX) Your homework is to watch ten Anthony Fantano videos, to get a gist of what music reviews look like. Class dismissed.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, neutral) See you in the next one!

Finally, class is over. Hmm... Looks like I have a few minutes before lunch. Who should I talk to?

[CHOICE]
*Talk to Digi*
*Talk to Gib*

*Talk to Digi*

I approach Digi. The closer I get to him, the more details I can see of his slovenly yet strangely handsome appearance. He looks a bit like Jesus, in a way.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, happyMIN) Oh, hey new kid, how do you like the class so far? I hope you enjoyed the subject, because you’re going to be hearing a whole lot more about it.

(PCPG) Yeah it was... interesting.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, happyMAX) Well if you found that interesting you’re really going to like those Fantano videos I assigned you for homework. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, happyMAX) You know, it’s nice to have someone who actually takes an interest in my class. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, angryMED) Some people say I "unnecessarily insert my opinion into things." I don’t really see the point of "objective" teaching to begin with.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 3, happyMIN) Anyway, I’ve got motherfuckin’ shit to do that’s bigger than yo’ kiddie pool. If you want to talk more, I’ll be in the library after school. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 3, happyMIN) Nice meeting ya, new kid.

[SLIDE Digi offright]
[Digi leaves]
At first I thought Digi was a self centered guy, but now that I’ve talked to him, I’m starting to realize that that doesn’t matter so much and he’s still a pretty sweet dude. 

I think I’ll enjoy this class.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, default, neutral, offleft, slide, center) It’s getting pretty close to lunch, we should get going.

(PCPG) Sure thing, lets go.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, default, neutral, offleft, slide, center) Soo, how did you feel about your first class?

(PCPG) Well, it was... interesting.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, handsup, happyMIN) Yeah, most people tend to feel that way at first. But don’t worry, you’ll warm up to the folk here eventually. 

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, handsup, happyMIN) They’re like prickly pears: Hard on the outside, but if you crack ‘em open they’re full of juicy red bits.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, grabby, confusedMIN) If you wanna know more about Professor Digibro, he usually hangs out in the library after school. I dunno what he actually [i]does[/i] there though.

(Gibbon|Gib, campus, default, neutral, center, slide, offright) Anyway, it’s getting pretty close to lunch, we should get going.

[Gibbon leaves]
I was kind of afraid of this whole university thing at first. It’s good to know that someone as nice as Gibbon is here to guide me. 

I think I’ll enjoy my time in this place after all.

All these wacky introductions have left me starving, I can’t wait to finally chow down.
[fade to black]
[Location: dininghall.demo]
[SFX: PCP-SFX_DoorOpen]
[fade from black]
As I push open the doors to the cafeteria, I find myself at an unexpected scene.

The hall itself is pretty normal looking. Grey rubber floors, scratched peach walls, and a fairly high ceiling with windows lining the top.

However, while the people at the tables are separated into different cliques, the cliques themselves are kinda different from what I expected.

[ZOOM 0.5 -0.5 -0.1 0.66]

There’s a table full of what appear to be pirates speaking in weebanese and playing cool music.

[ZOOM 0.5 0 -0.1 0.66]

Another has a bunch of rowdy students madly shaking about like they all are having a stroke. What the fuck?

[ZOOM 0.5 0.5 -0.2 0.66]

Another is just consumed by a huge cloud of smoke, or wait, is that vapor?

[ZOOM 0.5 -0.5 -0.25 0.66]

Another has a group of students complaining about their food to each other as they’re eating it. But the weird part is that massive bag next to them labeled ‘Dads.’

(PCPG) Uh, Gibbon, are there... people... in that bag?

[ZOOM 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.66]

(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN, offright, slide, right) Yeah don’t worry about it, they’re just being cool you know?

(PCPG) Yeah...

[SLIDE Gibbon offright]
I don’t think I’m quite comfortable with the implication here, but if Gibbon says they’re just being cool, then I guess they’re just being cool.

(Mage|???, campus, 1, neutral, silhouette) Hey! I haven’t seen you around before.

A female voice from behind catches my attention.

(PCPG) Hm? Oh, right! Yes, I haven’t. Haven’t been here before, that is! I’m the new guy. That’s me.

(Mage|???, campus, 4, happyMED) There’s no need to be so nervous, I won't bite. I know this school can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, but you’ll get used to it.

(Mage|???, campus, 3, happyMIN) If you ever have any problems, just talk to the student council! I’m the vice president, always happy to help out a fellow student.

(PCPG) Well in that case, can the student council solve my current hunger problem?

(Mage|???, campus, 5, happyMED) Not directly, but I’m sure the cafeteria staff can help you with that.

(Mage|???, campus, 5, sadMIN) Not that I’m a big fan of the menu here though...

(PCPG) What’s wrong with it?

(Mage|???, campus, 2, angryMED) It still doesn’t offer candy corn! We filed an application for it like three months ago!

(Mage|???, campus, 1, shockMIN) Oh! Sorry for shouting, that wasn’t a good first impression, was it?

(Mage|???, campus, 4, neutral) Anyway, you’re in Professor Tinyhat’s art class after lunch right? I need to go now, but I have that class too, so we’ll meet again then. Bye!

[Mage leaves]
Before I get a chance to say "bye" back, she had already skipped away. Now that I think about it, I didn’t even manage to catch her name. Oh well, I’ll ask her in art class.

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral, offright, slide, right)
I catch up to Gibbon waiting for me in the line as I look up at the menu options, which consists of the usual coloured pills, like forty strains of weed, Huel, and of course, pizza, cause every place has to have fucking pizza.

Sorry, didn’t mean to get aggressive there, just a pet peeve of mine.

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral) I hear the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza is pretty good, never tried it though.

I look through the pizza options and find that Gibbon’s suggestion is far too rich for my poor boi wallet. In fact, this whole menu is unreasonably overpriced. Cheap-ass school.

As I scan the menu to try to find something I could afford, I eventually stumble upon the cheapest option I see. Keto pizza. How the hell does that even work?

(Gibbon, campus, press, sadMIN) I would’ve said to get the chicken n’ tea as a cheaper option, but it's a pretty popular dish so it always gets sold out quickly.
[SLIDE Gibbon offright]
I decide to grab some blue pills and a “keto” pizza slice, then follow Gibbon to a table. Given how eccentric the cliques here are, I wonder what kinda table Gibbon sits at.

[Location: dininghall.demo, dininghall.table.mudpuddleforeground]

We stop at normal looking table with some normal looking students. Hmm, what’s the catch?

Actually wait a second, these students aren’t normal at all. Perhaps the strangest of the bunch... 

They’re European. /n
German, I think?

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral, offright, slide, center)
I make the smart decision to avoid talking to them, and go over to where Gibbon is sitting at, but before I manage to sit down I almost step into a small patch of mud that looks like it was crudely dug out of the rubber floors of the cafeteria.

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, shockedMIN, center, slide, right) Mind the mud puddle, don’t want it getting dirty.

(PCPG) Wait, did you dig this out yourself?

(Gibbon, campus, press, neutral) Well, you know, me and the rest of these guys. Took us a while ‘cause the only useful digging tools in this school are spoons, but it was worth it.

(PCPG) Oh...
[SLIDE Gibbon center]
Careful of the “mud puddle,” I sit down in front of Gibbon and pop some blue pills before eating the “keto” pizza. It’s fucking disgusting.

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, neutral) I mean with this school being dominated by slime, I had to dig out my own place of mud.

(PCPG) Dominated by slime?

[SLIDE Gibbon left]
(Endless War|???, stand, neutral, silhouette) You heard him right.

A new female voice replies from behind me, and this one doesn’t sound so happy to see me. I look back and see her gesturing to the cafeteria table enveloped by vapor.

As I look over I see a blob of slime shoot out of the vapor and splash onto the nearby table of rowdy students who were shaking about. They don’t look pleased at the donation and begin to retaliate with their own slime.

(Endless War|???, stand, happyMIN) Hello there Gibbon, or perhaps I should call you-

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, angryMED, left, slide, left+350)
(Endless War|???, stand, shockedMIN) !!!
Before the girl finishes her sentence Gibbon quickly shuts her up with his hand.

(Gibbon, campus, clenched, angryMIN) Hey Endless War.

(Gibbon, campus, clenched, angryMIN, left+350, slide, left)
(Endless War, stand, smittenMIN) Oh, shy are we now? 

(Endless War, stand, confusedMIN) You wouldn’t happen to know where Gun Girl is nowadays? I hardly see her ‘round the Cop Killers anymore.

(Gibbon, campus, grabby, angryMED, left) I have no idea what you’re talking about.

They both go silent as they stare each other down. I guess they have history?

(Endless War, knife, angryMED) Well never mind, there is a more important task at hand. You’re showing a new juvie around school and you don’t even mention the [i]WAR?[/i]

(Endless War, knife, angryMIN)
Endless War turns to face me. Her gaze nearly turns me to stone.

(Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Allow me to introduce you to it then.

(Endless War, stand, neutral) You see this school is in the middle of a violent and dangerous gang war between the Rowdy Fuckers...

[SLIDE EndlessWar offright]
[SLIDE Gibbon offleft]
[Zoom in on Rowdy Fuckers table]

Using her middle finger she points to the rowdy table, now menacingly looking over to the vapor table with wooden clubs in hand.

(Endless War) ...and the Cop Killers.

[Zoom in on Cop Killers table]

She moves her finger to the vapor table, where the vapor is starting to clear up, revealing students holding guns of various sizes.

(Endless War) Ugh, guns are such an impersonal way to kill, don’t you think? They just scream to me that you don’t actually [i]enjoy[/i] killing, which I assume is how most of the “gang members” here actually feel. 

(Endless War) I have a good feeling that will change soon... VERY soon...

Gunshots fill the hall as the fight truly breaks out between them. The rest of the students rush out of the hall, though they don’t seem too scared of the violence, almost as if it’s a common occurrence.

(PCPG) We should probably leave too, Gibbon.

[SLIDE Gibbon offleft]
Gibbon gives me a quick nod and heads for the cafeteria door.

(Endless War, knife, smittenMIN|blushMIN) You don’t wanna join in, juvie?

(Endless War, knife, smittenMED|blushMED) I guess you haven’t chosen a side yet. No worries, soon enough you will. Soon enough.

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMAX) I’m gonna introduce you to the finest of arts, because - if you haven’t figured it out yet - I’m Munchy J. Shatsky, a.k.a. “Professor Tinyhats,” a.k.a. “Munchy” if your attention span’s too fucking short to remember how to address me properly.

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMAX) Let's get right down to the fundamentals. There are exactly THREE art forms! Everything else is not art.

(Munchy, campus, 2, angryMIN) Books? Not art! Don’t even have pictures!

(Munchy, campus, 2, angryMED): Music? Pretty okay I guess, but not REAL ART!

(Munchy, campus, 3, angryMED) The first art form is DRAWING!

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMED) It’s pretty cool, I know. It’s one of the easiest ways to make something of worth in society, all you have to do is move a fucking pencil around. Can you believe it? That’ll only get you so far though, the REAL motherfuckers know how to do this shit CLEANLY and efficiently.

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMAX) The real masters of the craft. The REAL cowboys. The only humans worth something, the ones who can QUICK-DRAW.

Huh? What is that even supposed to mean?

(Munchy, campus, 1, angryMIN) I’ll be your mentor, because having a great teacher is obviously better than not going to school and trying to learn everything by yourself! This is why I was educated here, in the PCP University, AND LOOK WHERE I AM NOW!

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMED) But let’s get to the second of the REAL art forms! Any guesses?

(Mage, campus, 4, neutral, offleft, slide, left) Ahem... animation?

(Munchy, campus, 3, happyMED) What’s better than making art, and not only that, being able to eat it, too?

(Munchy, campus, 2, angryMIN)
(Tom|???, 1, angryMED, right) Fuck this shit. Cooking is too humancore for me!

(PCPG) What do you mean by that? I like cooked food.

(Tom|???, 1, angryMIN) If you ever have to live in a car for months, cooking takes you nowhere. How am I supposed to use Prof. Tinyhats’ recipes if I can’t afford the ingredients?

(PCPG) Wait, aren’t I the only new student here? Not sure if that’s a good idea.

(Munchy, campus, 1, happyMIN) I will be there anyways! The whole afternoon! Just come over, it’s impossible to miss me.

[Scene: This Book and Others]

[Location: library]
[Song: PCPDating_LibraryTheme]
[fade from black]

I enter the library, and am immediately overwhelmed by rows of books, manga, and games as far as the eye can see. 

But all of these forms of media mean nothing to me. I immediately find the aisle that is far more familiar to me: 

Light novels.

I peruse the books for a bit before one catches my eye. It’s titled The Asterisk War. 

I begin reading the book on the spot and soon get really invested in it, but then suddenly am overwhelmed by the scent of weed looming over me.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, HappyMED, offright, slide, center) Watcha reading?

My eyes start burning as Professor Digibro takes a hit of his dab pen and proceeds to exhale marijuana smoke directly onto my face. 

Once the smoke clears, I catch a glimpse of them; Digi’s titillating round sunglasses.

(PCPG) Is smoking allowed in here?

Digibro snatches the book out of my hands. He looks at the novel and almost immediately winces in disgust.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 5, HappyMAX) I don’t give a fuck whether it is or not. And even if it was, that wouldn’t be nearly as worrying as them allowing students to read shit like ‘Ass War’.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, smittenMAX) I can’t believe someone as cool as you would consume such garbage.

Digibro tosses The Asterisk War away with such vigor that, upon colliding with the wall, it disintegrates instantly. 

He pulls another light novel out of his pocket, which I failed to notice due to the immense baggy spaciousness of his robe.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 4, smittenMIN) Here, try this!

Digibro shoves the small book into my arms. For a brief moment, I feel Digi’s soft tender skin brushing up against mine. 

I look this new light novel over. It is titled Boogiepop and Others.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, HappyMAX) Boogiepop and Others is really fuckin good, it’s easily my favorite light novel! 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, HappyMAX) You’re lucky I got here in time before you were subjected to the utter garbage that is Ass War. Here, sit down with me.

We sit down between the stuffed bookshelves and Digi motions for me to read the light novel he gave me. He pulls out what appears to be a manga and starts reading it.

(PCPG) So, what exactly do you do in here anyways?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 5, HappyMIN) Eh, whatever I feel like doing. Today I’m researching some new doujins for my good friend the Hentai Samurai.

(PCPG) Who is that?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 1, confusedMIN) You’ve never heard of the Hentai Samurai? He reviews all the best 10/10 hentai. Just search him up on your favorite porn site!

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 1, happyMIN) Anyways, you should start reading this book.

(PCPG) Which book?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, angryMIN) This book. This book! 

(PCPG) Boogiepop and Others? 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, smittenMED) I think the audience knows what kinda book I’m talking about.

(PCPG) What audience? What are you talking about?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 5, angryMED) THIS BOOK. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This [i]book[/i]. This book. This book? This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. [i]This [/i]book. This book. This book. This book.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, happyMAX) This book! This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This BOOK. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. This b o o k. This book. This book. This BooK. This book. This book? This book. This book. This book. This book. This book. [i]This book[/i]. This book. This bookkk This book.

Utterly confused by what’s going on I just begin reading Boogiepop, and after a while Digi finally stops. 

He’s now just watching me as I slowly turn the pages, which doesn’t feel as creepy as I thought it would. After finishing a chapter Digi speaks up.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, happyMIN) So, what do you think of Boogiepop and Others?

[CHOICE]
*It’s great, thanks for suggesting it to me!*
*It’s ok I guess, but I’d rather be reading The Asterisk War right now.*

*It’s great, thanks for suggesting it to me!*

(PCPG) It’s great, thanks for suggesting it to me!

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 1, smittenMIN) R-really? It’s pretty dense on your first read, I’m glad you like it.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 1, happyMIN) I was thinking that maybe you and I could hang again sometime. I... I could recommend you some more books... an... and maybe I could get to know you some more...

My heart is pounding out of my chest. Have I finally found someone I can call a friend or maybe even... something more? 

I look Digi in the eyes and see my reflection in his sunglasses.

(PCPG) Y... yeah, I’d like that.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 1, smittenMIN) Good, I’m glad.

I feel myself being enraptured by the warmth in Digi’s smile. My face feels warm as it begins to redden like a tomato.

An awkward tension fills the air and we go back to reading for a few hours. 

We take occasional respites to discuss literature, but other than that, most of our time together was spent in silence. 

But it’s strange. Even though we didn’t talk very much, I still relish in Digi’s company.

After reading, I decide that it is about time I should head home. I stand up to leave.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, sadMIN) You’re leaving already? Well, maybe we could hang out and read again sometime. I’ve been formulating a list of more media I think you would like.

(PCPG) Yeah, that would be nice.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 4, happyMAX) Good! I’ll make that list for the next time we hang out! See ya later!

[SLIDE Digi offright]
[Digi leaves]
I leave the library and head home, filled with a subtle satisfaction that I am getting to know more and more people at this new school in a more [i]intimate[/i] way.

*It’s ok I guess, but I’d rather be reading The Asterisk War right now.*

(PCPG) It’s ok I guess, but I’d rather be reading The Asterisk War right now.
(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, angryMED)
Digi lurches upward from his seat, snatching the book from my hands. I jump backwards, surprised.

(PCPG) Are you okay?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, angryMAX) I AM FUCKING NOT OKAY!
(Digi, casual, 3, smittenMAX)
Digi wields a slight smile so as to suggest that his anger is all in jest... or at least I hope that is the case.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, angryMAX) How in the FUCK do you think that is passable in any way?

Digibro pulls out another copy of The Asterisk War off the bookshelf, flips to a random page, and shoves the book in my face while pointing at it.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 3, angryMAX) Look at this shit! LOOK AT THIS SHIT! This is GARBAGGIO! This is garbage! I can not believe that you are ok with this! This is a FUCKING PROBLEM!

(PCPG) I thought objectivity didn’t exist.

The Professor then takes a few deep breaths, almost as if he’s hyperventilating. He then immediately calms down, almost making me doubt he was even angry in the first place.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, happyMED) Standing up for yourself? I like it. Give me an essay on what’s interesting about The Asterisk War by... whenever you feel like.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, casual, 2, neutral) Well, see you next class.

[SLIDE Digi offright]
[Digi leaves]
Digi went from seething with rage to perfectly calm in a matter of moments. I’m not really sure what to make of that. I wonder if I ruined my friendship with him...

I check the clock. It is getting pretty late, so I decide to head home for the evening.

Why did Munchy mention this place for a meeting? A 7 Eleven doesn’t seem like a place where anyone would want to spend their time. This one in particular seems like a hot spot for homeless guys and losers. I wonder if that sewer guy from this morning hangs around here too.

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMIN, offright, slide, center) Oh, there you are. I knew someone would come!

(PCPG) Hey Professor! So, what’s this private tutoring all about?

(Munchy, campus, 2, happyMED) Ahhh! Did I really call it private tutoring? Ok, well then, let me tutor you!

He points at some spray paint on one of the windows that reads “!THRASH”

(Munchy, campus, 1, happyMED) See this shit right here? This is GRAFFITI, my man. Some call it ‘vandalism’, but if you ask me, dismissing this shit as a crime is a crime in and of itself.

(Munchy, campus, 2, neutral) Now, I’m not gonna tell you to go out and do this kind of thing on your own just yet, but hey, it IS one of my favorite kinds of art, that which pays homage to ME. If you want to get to know me better, maybe check out the Rowdys. I’m sure they’re looking for new blood such as yourself. That’s all.

(9/11, pewpew) Hey my old friend! I’m working here now. Trying to save up for my own jet! 

(PCPG) What do you need a jet for?

(9/11, pewpew) Uhh, well let’s just say it’s for a real BOOMing idea AHAHAhaha...

I don’t get it.

(Munchy, campus, 3, happyMED) Hey did you know that I was born almost EXACTLY a year before you?

(9/11, concern) You never miss telling me that everytime we see each other on campus my dude!

(9/11, standin) You know what’s another annoying thing I hear on campus, these rumours that Bush somehow “did” me. I am not THAT easy okay. Even though Bush is a handsome hunk of a man, I am in no way homosexually attracted- 

(Bush|???) YOU BETTER NOT BE TALKING SMACK ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK 9/11! QUIT FUCKING AROUND AND GET THE FUCK BACK IN HERE!

(Munchy, campus, 1, confusedMED) Wait... that voice... is that the 43rd president of the United States George W. Bush himself?!?!

(9/11, concern) Yeah. God knows how he ended up being my manager.

(PCPG) Talk about a fall from grace. A manager of a 7 Eleven of all things!

(9/11, concern) Hard times, I guess.

(9/11, standin) Well, I better go now before Bush fucks me like he fucked this country.

The park was quite further away from the school than I originally expected, so by the time I got here it was already sunset. 

Unfortunately, the park itself is less exciting than I thought it would be, being mostly an empty field of grass and trees. Probably should’ve expected that.

There is that purple forest looking area near the end of the walkway, wonder what that’s about? /n
Since it’s the only notable thing in the park, I make my way towards it.
However, it’s only a matter of time before boredom takes over, and like the filthy millennial I am I pull out my phone to check Twitter. I can’t even enjoy a short walk in the park without social media consuming my every thought, how shameful. 

Yet before I can even scroll past the usual stream of liked hentai posts, someone runs into me and we both fall over.

After getting back up, I see a familiar cloud of hair in front of me.

(Gibbon, campus, grabby, sadMED) Ow fack, my head!

(PCPG) Sorry Gibbon, I guess I didn’t see you there.

(Gibbon, campus, default, sadMIN) Nah it’s fine. It really was my fault for not looking up from my phone.

(PCPG) What were you doing on your phone anyways?

(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN) I was just playing Pokémon Have.

(PCPG) Pokémon Have?

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral) Oh, I guess you would call it Pokémon Go.

(PCPG) Do people even play that anymore?

(Gibbon, campus, clenched, angryMIN) Hey it’s still a great game. Just because it’s no longer popular doesn’t mean you shouldn’t play it.

(PCPG) I guess so.

After only playing Pokémon Go once when it first blew up, I never really returned to it. I don’t exactly know why though, since it seemed like something I would enjoy. I guess I never had anyone to play it with.

(Gibbon, campus, press, happyMIN) Why don’t you join me? We could have a grand ol’ time catching Pokémon together.

While I still don’t particularly care for Pokémon Go, I don’t really have anything else to do at the moment. So I guess I could, if I really wanted to. I mean I did kinda want to check out that purple forest too though.

[CHOICE]
*Yea sure*
*Nah, maybe another time*

*Yea sure*

(PCPG) Yea sure, let me download it first.

[Gibbon leaves]
We spend the rest of the evening catching Pokémon. Gibbon teaches me quite a few tricks about the game, like how to throw Pokéballs correctly and where to find which Pokémon. 
It’s strange, the few hours we spent together catching Pokémon were probably the best hours I’ve ever had playing a video game. Is this what being a normie feels like?
[Location: woods]
[StopMusic]
[Song: PCPDating_DateTheme]

After Pokémon Going around for a while, we find a nice area to stop for a bit hidden between the trees. Squirrels come and go around us as we lean on one of the massive trees and take a breath. The purple glow emanating from beyond the trees keeps me mildly curious as to their nature, but I decide to figure them out another time.

(Gibbon, campus, grabby, neutral, offright, slide, center)
I snatch a quick glance of Gibbon and find him mesmerized by the squirrels.

(PCPG) So I’ve been meaning to ask, why do you carry your plushies around with you?

(Gibbon, campus, clenched, angryMED) Why wouldn’t I? They’re soft and cuddly and I love them. Why don’t YOU carry plushies around with YOU, huh?

(PCPG) Oh uh, yeah, I guess you’re right.

Guess I struck a nerve with that question.

(PCPG) ...

(PCPG) Soo, what are their names?

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, happyMIN) Well, in the bag here we have Pumk, a wily pumpkin lass who don’t take no guff from no BIG CHEESE. She’s the coolest.

(PCPG) I see...

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, neutral) Next to her is Guin, Lord of Sin. Other than going on a bloodthirsty rage for vengeance over the death of Club Penguin every so often, he’s a pretty chill guy.

(PCPG) Well that’s nice to hear.

(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMED) And finally, this little hippopotamus is Fiona. I saved her from the zoo and gave her a hat so now she hangs out with me wherever I go.

(PCPG) Saved her from the zoo?

(Gibbon, campus, grabby, confusedMIN) I mean I technically stole her from there, but she is just the cutest little shit that I’ve ever seen and I just couldn’t leave her there all alone.

(Gibbon, campus, default, shockedMIN) I have so many more back at my place! I mean, you haven’t even met Vriska yet. You should totally come over sometime.

(PCPG) I’ll uhh, consider it.

Gibbon then stands up straight and stretches.

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral) Speaking of my place, it’s getting late so I better go home. I had a very nice time hanging out with you today, so I hope we can do it again sometime.

(PCPG) Yeah, same here.

(Gibbon, campus, default, smittenMIN|blushMIN) Well, see you later then.

[Gibbon leaves]
Gibbon then walks off leaving me alone with the squirrels. Other than being a little strange he really seems like a nice guy. I hope I can get to know him better during my time here.
*

*Nah, maybe another time*

(PCPG) Nah, maybe another time. I only really wanted to check out the park for a bit.

(Gibbon, campus, default, sadMIN) Oh, no worries. Maybe you could come over to my place sometime to hang out, when you’re more free of course.

(PCPG) That sounds like a good idea. Invite me over anytime.

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral) Well, I still have some catching to do so I guess I’ll see ya tomorrow then.

(PCPG) Yea, see you then.

[Gibbon leaves]
I watch as Gibbon walks off, phone in hand, and wonder if I should have just gone with him. Too late now I guess. I continue onwards towards the purple forest.

As I near closer a figure comes walking out of it, and soon I realize that it’s Mage. Something looks a little different about her... probably just her clothes. I run up to say hi.

(PCPG) Hey Mage!

(Mage, casual, 3, happyMIN, fade, center) Oh hey PCPG, what brings you here?

(PCPG) I don’t know, maybe the literal purple forest that’s right behind you? What were you doing in there anyways?

(Mage, casual, 1, shockedMIN) No need to be so suspicious, I was just enjoying the scenery.

(Mage, casual, 2, happyMIN) I just love forests and trees, especially how peaceful and powerful they can feel. This forest in particular is one of my favourites. Everything comes together to make it magical.

(PCPG) Wow, that sounds wonderful. But, what’s with the outfit then?

(Mage, casual, 3, smittenMIN) Oh, I just think this looked cute, so I try to wear it wherever I can. What, do you not think it’s cute?

(PCPG) Uhh, y-yeah it’s pretty c-cute on you.

Did I just admit to being a furry? Fuck.

(PCPG) Well, um, I’ll be checking out the forest now, so I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then.

(Mage, casual, 4, shockedMED) Wait! I would kindly ask you to not enter the purple part of the forest!

(PCPG) Wait, why not? After how much you praised it, I’d imagine you’d want more people to see it.

(Mage, casual, 4, angryMED) It’s... a secret. I don’t think you or anyone should know about it... yet. It’s something I would only share with people I know I can trust.

I’m taken aback by this sudden change in her attitude. Maybe I should just trust her on this one.

(PCPG) Uh, yeah, sure. I won't go in there.

(Mage, casual, 3, happyMED) Well, thank you. It’s getting late, so you shouldn’t stay out too long. There are violent gangs in the streets, and honestly you don’t look like you can put up much of a fight. See ya tomorrow!

(PCPG) Yeah, see you then.

[Mage leaves]
As Mage walks away I feel as though I’ve stumbled onto something I really shouldn’t have. I mean, what possible reason would she have for asking me to not enter? I take a long look at the forest before turning around and heading back home.

I try my best to sneak in as inconspicuously as possible while the professor continues his lecture. Hopefully he doesn’t catch me coming in.

(Tom, 1, neutral, offright, slide, right)
I see a familiar face with an empty desk next to him, so I take a seat. What was his name again?

(Tom, 1, neutral, right, slide, offright)
(Nate, campus, papers, happyMED|shades) And that’s why the only true enemy is willful ignorance!

Awesome, Nate didn’t notice me come in.

(Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) Alright. Now let’s see if you guys at all understood what I was talking about!

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) Who can tell me one of the problems with socialism?

Oh no, don’t tell me the professor is just using this Philosophy class to push his political agenda. I hope I don’t see more of this.

(Nate, campus, smoking, angryMIN|shades) Anyone?

The class is silent.

(Nate, campus, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) How about we have the new kid show us what they’ve learned today! 

Shit.

(Nate, campus, pointing, angryMED|shades) PCPG! Stand and deliver!

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades)$
I arise from my desk. The only thing I heard while I was sneaking in was something about willful ignorance... I’m not sure that’s going to help me here.

(Tom|???, 4, angryMIN, offright, slide, right) [i]Pssssstttt! PCPG![/i]

(Tom|???, 2, angryMIN) [i]Psssttt! Humanity is inherently lazy![/i]

What!? Why is he trying to distract me with utter nonsense while I’m being probed and scrutinized by Nate?!

(Tom|???, 4, shockedMAX)[i] Pssstt!! In a socialist world, there is no incentive to work hard as the system always ensures your rewards are unchanged regardless of effort or achievement![/i]

Oh wait, I'm fucking retarded.

(Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades)
(PCPG) Uhhhh... Nate... the reason socialism is bad is... because of... incentives...  and rewards... and laziness?

(Tom, 3, confusedMAX)
My deskmate facepalms beside me.

(Tom, 1, neutral)
(Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) ...

(Nate, campus, smoking, confusedMAX|shades) That’s not quite it, PCPG. 

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) I urge you to come to class on time in order to assure knowledge of the material.

He [i]did[/i] see me come in after all...

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, confusedMIN|shades) And [i]please[/i] call me Professor Bestman. Don’t be disrespectful.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, shockMIN|shades) The trouble with socialism is that people are inherently selfish and lazy. There needs to be an incentive to work hard and achieve beyond the bare minimum. 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, angryMIN|shades) That is why capitalism is the single system I trust, because it operates on the only reliable human impulse: Self-interest!

Why does it seem like he’s directing his statement at me?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades) If someone is left to their own devices, they will take advantage of societal good-will and welfare in order to laze around, and when things don’t go their way, they’ll blame everyone but themselves.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades) But that’s enough about that. It’s important you all learn to not let politics preoccupy too much of your time.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, angryMIN|shades) Politics very easily turns into an opiate for the masses to distract themselves from actually fixing their lives. They want someone to blame for their failures.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, angryMIN|shades) You have to rise up and work hard to get what you want. You only have one life! Don’t ask for lighter burdens; ask for broader shoulders!

Man, he sure is passionate about this.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, neutral|shades) I want to leave you with one thing.

Professor Bestman takes a contemplative pause before continuing.

(Tom, 4, shockedMIN, right) The free part sounds great and all, but there really isn’t any satisfaction to killing someone if there aren’t any sick combat animations. You gotta feel that slice.

(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, campus, crossing, confusedMIN) Oh there’s plenty of SLICING found in our gang warfare juvie! Do you want me to show you how to !kill?

(Tom, 1, angryMIN) Feel free to try, I’ll dropkick spindash the shit out of you.

The situation seems to be getting heated, but I really don’t have the confidence to step in yet, let alone the necessary combat skills should things escalate further.

(Mage, campus, 3, angryMIN) Guys guys stop it! Besides Tom, I think that wouldn’t help you at all in a real fight.

(Tom, 1, shockedMAX) And how would you know? I’ve seen PLENTY of shounen fight scenes, I think I know what I'm talking about here! Or is there something else you want to tell us, Mage?

(Munchy|Professor Tinyhats, campus, default, angryMED) Yeah Mage! Do you have some exquisite combat experience hidden behind that innocent purple image of yours?

(Mage, campus, 5, shockMED) Uhm... n-no, of course not! I was just-

Tom leads me to a car that’s parked near the gate.

(Tom, 3, shockedMIN) So, you’re the new... art-guy?

(PCPG) I guess, or maybe I’m an aspiring chef, who knows at this point. What even are the usual programs at this school? It’s all very confusing.

(Tom, 3, confusedMIN) I’d be lying if I said you’ll get used to it. The people here either stay confused, or they get swallowed by the weirdness.

(Tom, cider, happyMAX) Have some wine! Between the nut job teachers and the pernicious PCPyramid scheme, you won’t survive the semester sober.

Pyramid scheme?

In addition to his strange advice, the beverage he’s offering very clearly isn’t wine.

*Roll with it*

Apart from the fact that this is clearly a practical lesson on accepting strange shit, 

only a complete fool would out themselves as terminally uncool in front of a new classmate, by getting hung up on pedantic details like what category of drink something belongs to.

I take the cider and clink the rim of my can on his, as though we were holding wine glasses.

(PCPG) À ta santé.

(Tom, cider, happyMIN) Dude, that was smooth as fuck, you get it.

The “wine” is pretty good.

(PCPG) Is it really such a great idea to be drinking if you have to drive home?

(Tom, 2, confusedMAX) This is home.

He points to a sleeping bag on the back seat.

(Tom, cider, smittenMAX) At least temporarily. Call it saint-ian minimalism, but I think it’s kinda dope.

It’s probably better not to ask why he’s attempting to live in his car. Seems a bit early for that.

(PCPG) You’re in Philosophy too right? I’m sure the prof of that class would love your coinage of that phrase.

(Tom, cider, angryMIN) He definitely would. Both of them, actually, but for different reasons. The whole bifurcation of the Philosophy course is such bullshit.

(PCPG) I mean, I guess there is a point to it. Exposing students to different perspectives and stuff...

(Tom, 4, shockedMAX) Oh for sure, if they didn’t spend half the time making passive aggressive comments about each other. 

(Tom, 4, shockedMAX) They could teach the entire class in a debate format. “Two Best Brothers Bitch About Philosophy” or something like that would be sick. 

(Tom, cider, confusedMIN) As it stands, you’re probably better off reading stuff for yourself.

(PCPG) You sure don’t seem all that enthusiastic about the PCPU.

(Tom, cider, drunkMIN) Well it is kind of fucking depressing, you know? To attend the classes of people you used to teach with every day... 

(Tom, cider, drunkMIN) Cause they found a new field and you didn’t, or at least not in time.

(PCPG) What do you mean “teach with them”?

(Tom, cider, drunkMIN) Oh, this university used to specialize in only one field of study: Equine media analysis. 

(Tom, cider, drunkMIN) We were the go-to school for anyone who thought gender studies was too useful a major. Digi and I mostly ran the place. 

(Tom, cider, happyMIN) That is until the autism scandal of course.

He takes a long sip from his beverage.

(Tom, 3, drunkMAX) We had a huge rebranding after that. More or less the same people are still in charge, we kicked out all the old students though. 

(Tom, 3, drunkMAX) I tried to find something new to teach, tried out a bunch of shit actually. 

(Tom, cider, drunkMIN) Now I’m a code-boi but all my relevance is gone. All I have is this dumb-ass scholarship, and I’m pretty sure they’ll take that away soon. 

(Tom, cider, angryMAX) Fuck all of this.

(PCPG) Umm...

Tom seems to have forgotten that I was here.

(Tom, cider, shockedMAX) Oh fuck, you should probably get to your next class huh? See what "Doomer" Philosophy has to offer you. Imma skip this one, not in the mood right now.

As soon as I enter the Philosophy class something massive tackles my chest sending me to the ground. Its large furry mass weighs heavy on my stomach, winding me of any air.

(Brunswick|???) MAMO!

(PCPG) he...lp m...e

(Ben|???) Woah calm down there buddy, we don’t want to kill off the new student quite yet. Come on, get off of him.

(Ben, campus, base, neutral)
(Brunswick, body, neutral, right)
[fade from black]
The beast obliges and the enormous weight finally lifts from my body, revealing itself as a Momoswine.

(Ben|???, campus, base, neutral) Sorry about that, but Brunswick here just loves to charge 
right in, to a fault really.

The menacing being offers his hand to me, which I accept, and he helps me up. 

(Ben|Ben Saint, campus, base, happyMIN|cloud) The name’s Ben Saint by the way, your teacher for this class.

(PCPG) Thanks, uh, Professor Saint, but why is there a Mamoswine in the classroom anyways?

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, happyMIN) Well wouldn’t you want to know...

(PCPG) ...

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, neutral) ...

(PCPG) Uh, yeah, I would?

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, sadMIN) Oh, right. I guess I [i]can[/i] just tell you.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) Brunswick here, an old friend of mine who bravely died in the line of duty during our travels, escaped covertly from Pokémon Hell to battle in the well known third PCP Royal Rumble in order to buy out his freedom from a certain evil spectre, but unfortunately he lost the Rumble to a literal arm and now has to live out the rest of his numbered days in hiding to avoid being dragged back down to his fiery abode.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, happyMIN|cloud) In other words, he’s our class pet.

(Brunswick, body, neutral, right) Swine!

(PCPG) Right...

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, angryMAX) And is very important to me, so you all better treat him with extreme care. If any of you FUCKS dare let anyone else know he’s here, you will experience a fate far worse than Pokémon Hell, I’ll guarantee you that.

The class goes silent at the threat. 

(Brunswick, body, neutral, right) Mamo!

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) Okay enough of that bullshit, all of you better sit down and shut the fuck up.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) For those of you who don’t know me yet, Ben Saint at your service, your Science and, for this class, the ONLY worthwhile Philosophy teacher.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, dab) But more importantly, your resident and confirmed best Kingpin, THE Cop Killer, ready to !dab on all the haters! !dab !dab !dab

Suddenly half of the class gets up from their seats and !dabs along with him aggressively. So this is the Cop Killers leader huh?

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, dab) Be sure to also check out patreon.com/bensaint and give me money so I can keep on dabbing forever, bitch. !dab !dab !dab

He seems pretty cool.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) Okay alright settle down, we unfortunately have to get back to the boring school bullshit now.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral|cloud) I mostly don’t really give a shit what you do during class, just don’t interrupt me while I’m talking and we’ll have a swell old time. I do hand out nuggets of wisdom from time to time, so do watch out for those if you’re interested.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, happyMIN|cloud) And you know what, as a special treat to start today's lesson off I’ll hand out one of those nuggets for free. 

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, point, neutral) Consider this, anything you ever think about consuming is nothing but a lie placed before you by the capitalist hierarchy in order to siphon power away from you and towards the upper echelon.

Oh god, not again.

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, exasp, angryMIN) And if you do nothing to oppose that system, if you choose not to stand by the people who oppose it, then all you are doing is endorsing the status quo. You might as well be siphoning that power yourself!

(PCPG) Uh, Professor Saint?

(Ben|Professor Saint, campus, base, neutral) Oh [i]please[/i] drop the title, it’s just embarrassing.

(PCPG) Uh, okay. Ben, what in the fuck does this have to do with Philosophy? You’re taking a real hard left turn here.

(Ben, campus, base, confusedMIN) Huh? Why the fuck else are people depressed if not for this shitty system fucking them over? This is clearly foundational stuff I need to teach in order to understand why we are doomed and fucked and how we can change that.

(PCPG) Uhh, I mean I guess so...

(Ben, campus, base, neutral) Okay, so as I was saying...

I automatically tune out the rest of Ben’s lecture as my ears flood with all kinds of political jargon, and frankly, I really don’t want to hear any of that right now. It seems like I am not alone in this stance as I notice several other students nodding off at their desks. A few students even just straight up leave as he’s talking.

As I think about whether I should join them in their delinquency, a strange presence holds me to my seat.

(Ben, campus, exasp, shockMAX, center, slide, left)
[Location: philosophyclass.d.portal]

Suddenly, the room begins to heat up, as a literal portal in spacetime rips itself open before my eyes, consuming some of the classes desks and chairs, and revealing within it a fiery inferno.

(Ben, campus, slouch, sadMIN, left) That must be... Pokémon Hell. So that means...

(Russel|???, bigboi, neutral) It’s been a while, hasn’t it Brunswick?

(Brunswick, worried, right) Mamo...

(Russel|???, bigboi, neutral) It’s time for you to say goodbye to your “friend” here and come back down to Pokémon Hell, where you truly belong.

(Ben, campus, exasp, angryMIN) Oh fuck off Russel, don’t you have enough Pokémon down there to suck you off already?

(Russel, bigboi, neutral) But Ben Saint, you of all people should realize...

(Russel, bigboi, neutral) It’s [i]never[/i] enough.

(Brunswick, body, confused, right)
Russel then unleashes what looks to be a Confuse Ray at the startled Brunswick, hitting him directly and confusing him.

(Russel, bigboi, neutral, center, slide, center-50) Alright Brunswick, now all you need to do is to enter the friendly portal where you can meet up with all of your favourite friends, those who were brutally murdered by your ever so precious Ben Saint.

(Brunswick, body, confused, right, slide, right-50)
Brunswick in his confusion obeys Russel's command and slumbers his way towards the portal.

(Brunswick, body, confused, right-50, slide, right-100)
(Ben, campus, exasp, sadMIN) Brunswick! Please snap out of it, you’re better than this! Don’t do this to me!

(Brunswick, body, confused, right-100, slide, right-150)
(Ben, campus, slouch, sadMAX) I can’t lose you again!

(Brunswick, body, confused, right-150, slide, right-250)
But despite Ben’s pleas, Brunswick continues slowly towards his doom. Students, seemingly caring more about Brunswick than Ben ever could, sacrifice their own wellbeing by climbing onto his hairy mass to stop him from entering the portal, but all is in vain. Brunswick is simply too massive and strong for their efforts.

(Brunswick, body, confused, right-250, slide, right-300)
Just before Brunswick falls into the portal and is consumed once more by the fire he escaped from, a commanding shout sounds from the classroom door.

[StopMusic]
(Lord of Ghosts|???, shock, blank, offright, slide, right) STOP!

(Lord of Ghosts, neutral, blank, right)
Somehow this gets to Brunswicks ears, stopping him inches from the portal’s edge.

(Russel, bigboi, worried, center-50) The Lord of Ghosts himself? But sir what are you doing here?

(Lord of Ghosts|The Lord of Ghosts, angry, blank, right) I WANT YOU TO LET GO OF THAT POKÉMON.

(Russel, bigboi, worried, center-50) B-but sir, he belongs in Pokémon Hell! I made a whole campaign to #LetRusselWrestle in order to defeat and capture him at the third PCP Royal Rumble, but I unfortunately missed my chance. This is now my time to drag him down to where he belongs!

(Lord of Ghosts|The Lord of Ghosts, neutral, blank, right) I DO NOT CARE. I AM THE LORD OF GHOSTS AND SO ALL GHOSTS MUST OBEY ME. THAT’S HOW IT WORKS.

(Russel, bigboi, worried, center-50) I guess... you are right sir.

(Lord of Ghosts, happy, blank, right)
(Brunswick, body, worried, right-300, slide, right-150)
Russel reluctantly snaps his fingers and Brunswick finally comes to his senses. After shaking off his confusion he steps away from the portal and lowers himself to let off the students on top of him.

(Russel, bigboi, neutral, center-50, slide, center) But do not worry Brunswick, despite not getting you this time, I will bring you back to Pokémon Hell soon enough.

(Brunswick, body, default, worried, center+50) Swine...

(Russel, bigboi, neutral) And you, Ben “Max Revive” Saint, don’t you worry either. You won't be separated from your “friends” for too long. In due time I will bring you down there too, and this time, for good.

(Ben, campus, base, happyMIN, left) I’d like to see you try you literal fart gas.

[Russel leaves]
[Location: philosophyclass.d]

Russel then enters back through the portal and closes it behind him, seemingly returning everything back to normal.

[Song: PCPDating_ClassPhilosophy]
(Brunswick, body, worried, center+50, slide, left)
(Ben, campus, base, happyMIN, left, slide, center) Wow, uh thanks for the save Lord of Ghosts. Even though we were previously enemies bent on dominating one another that one time, you helped me out big here.

(Lord of Ghosts|The Lord of Ghosts, blushMED, blank, right) DO NOT MENTION IT, FOR I AM THE LORD OF GHOSTS, THAT IS WHAT I DO.

(Lord of Ghosts|The Lord of Ghosts, neutral, blank, right) I HOWEVER MUST GO NOW, SO BYE BYE...

(Lord of Ghosts, neutral, blank, right, slide, offright)
Unlike Russel, the Lord of Ghosts uses the classroom door to leave us, a far more considerate exit for those who are easily spooked. That Lord of Ghosts guy must be a real samaritan though, helping Brunswick out like that out of the blue. 

His voice sounded awfully familiar. Have I met him before?

(Ben, campus, exasp, angryMIN) Okay, so which one of you FUCKS tattled about Brunswick being here?

Nobody replies, obviously.

(Ben, campus, base, angryMAX) Fucking typical. Whoever you are, I will find you, and you [i]will[/i] suffer my wrath.

(Ben, campus, slouch, neutral) Ugh. I guess class is dismissed early today. I need to find a new place for Brunswick before Russel decides to make another visit.

(Brunswick, body, worried) Mamo...

[SLIDE Ben offright]
[SLIDE Brunswick offright]
Ben and Brunswick leave the class, and soon after students start to file out too. Man, this class sure did take one hell of a turn. Good thing it all worked out for the better in the end though.

Wait, where’s my bag? I’m sure I left it next to my desk where the portal ope-

Oh, well that’s just great. Fuck you Russel. Fuck you.

While examining the new, unfamiliar, definitely-not-recycled environment of my Japanese class, I am taken aback by a young man with floofy hair and deep blue eyes staring at me intently, 

as though he has completely removed the rest of the outside world from his perception.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, neutral)
Sure, I’m the new kid, I get it, 

but I couldn’t possibly be interesting enough as to warrant this kind of undiluted attention that would usually be reserved for the unprecedentedly fascinating exclusively.

He understands me, he KNOWS me, he...

(Colt Corona, thisvideo, angryMIN, offright, slide, offleft)
A passing disheveled looking horseman pushes me to the side.

[ColtCorona leaves]

...he wasn't looking at me. Neither the direction of his gaze, nor his expression has changed. Unaware of how he just broke my heart a little, he gazes on. What’s his deal?

I decide to alert him to my presence with a tap on the shoulder.

(PCPG) Hi, I’m PCPG!

(PCPG) So... you [i]are[/i] Professor Digi’s student in this class, right?

(Davoo, greeting, happyMIN) More like his assistant. Friggin Makise Kurisu-ing all over the goddamn place. I’m kind of a big deal.

He does a silly, lower pitched, voice, implying that he’s at least partially joking... I’m just not sure how much.

(Davoo, explaining, happyMAX) Anyways, as part of my assistant duties, I am obliged to ask you what you think of the lecture. 

(Davoo, explaining, happyMAX) So, what do you think? And don’t just answer, ruminate on it, really understand why you feel the way you do.

[CHOICE]
*It is eh*
*It is good*

*It is eh*

The question is... not all that simple to answer. While Digi’s point was clear and there was sick looking anime footage on screen, I’m not sure I... relate? 

I can appreciate his appreciation of less talked about aspects of visual storytelling, 

but the deeper understanding of meta-narrative intricacies doesn’t benefit me unless they were contributing factors to my enjoyment of media in the first place, 

making it easier for me to seek out those specific qualities. 

The lecture essentially only taught me how to find media which Digibro would enjoy, 

thereby exemplifying his skill with regards to this type of communication quite nicely but not being useful to me in the slightest. 

This isn’t “How to appreciate Digibro”-class after all, right? 

We should learn about the subject through the lens provided by our professor, not learn about the professor through the lens provided by the subject. 

What did any of this even have to do with Japanese?
*

*It is good*

The question is... not all that simple to answer. It probably was a bad Japanese lesson, right? 

No, It definitely was a bad Japanese lesson, I didn’t learn jack shit about the language apart from some technical terms regarding animation and the otaku subculture, 

which I’m pretty sure he didn’t pronounce correctly. 

But that’s more of a plus in a way. I was kind of worried this was gonna be legit language class and that sounds boring, 

so I’m actually really glad that it turned out to be media analysis interspersed with deep dives into the menacing mind of a madman. 

Pretty standard fare for this school as I’ve come to expect. 

Besides, whenever the topic did bore me a little, I could just enjoy the sakuga being projected onto the wall behind our ranting profs legitimately baller PowerPoint-Style tbh. 

So yeah, I think I liked it.
*

(PCPG) I guess I...

(Davoo, thinking) The point about abstraction was really interesting, especially when you extend it to other mediums, 

(Davoo, thinking) so I added some examples where the concept can be applied to video games especially in the powerpoint to really drive it home.

I admit to my verbal assailant that, without the powerpoint presentation, I likely wouldn’t have grasped half as much as I did of the lecture.

(Davoo, explaining, happyMIN) Yeah, exactly. I mean, that’s the point of having the friggin visual aid, right? 

(Davoo, explaining, happyMIN) To layer sensory inputs, in order to kind of divide the information up for different regions of the brain to analyze synchronously. 

(Davoo, explaining, happyMIN) To form a Gesamtkunstwerk if you will.

He seems really excited, and he sounds right, so sure, why not.

(PCPG) Hell yeah!

I just hope he doesn’t ask me what a “Gesamtkunstwerk” is. I’m not even sure how I would write that word.

(Davoo, greeting, neutral) I like you, new kid. A lot of students don’t really appreciate the prof's lecture style. What a bunch of IDIOTS. 

(Davoo, greeting, neutral) If you ever wanna compare notes or something, just ask.

Slipping into that parody voice appears to just be a thing he does. That’s kinda cute. 

The fact that showing some amount of interest in his work and the class in general gets him so excited is also pretty cute.

[SLIDE Davoo right+150]
Oh shit, he seems to consider this the end of our conversation and is about to leave.

(PCPG) Hey, you still haven’t told me your name! I can’t just call you “powerpoint-guy”.

(Davoo, fidgeting) Oh, I’m the Davoo, but you can just call me Davoo if you want.

(Davoo, greeting, neutral) Anyways, I’ve got to go now. Important stuff. Bye!

[Slide Davoo offright]

With that, he storms out of the classroom, assumably to tend to one of the many other irons this off-kilter guy undoubtedly has in the fire. Oh well, I’m sure I’ll see him again.

[Scene: Digibro’s To-Watch-List]

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMIN, offleft, slide, center) Oh, So you’ve met the Davoo.

(PCPG) Yeah, he... Man, he definitely was something.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, ShockMIN) He tends to make that kind of impression. Definitely an asset though.

(PCPG) Just his dedication or is he like some kind of expert?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, ConfusedMIN) Maybe in some respects, but he didn’t know jack shit about anime before he started this class. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 5, ConfusedMIN) Being a sucker for the analytical aspect naturally drew him here, I guess.

Huh.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, smittenMIN) You might have similar potential if I’m completely honest. Got that new kid energy of not fitting the fuck in anywhere.

(PCPG) Do you always insult your students out of the blue?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, AngryMED) Fuck yes, when they’re being obstinate pieces of shit. But that wasn’t an insult, I was the same way as a kid.

(PCPG) You’re also not exactly a role model now, you know. What exactly are you trying to tell me here?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 3, HappyMIN) It’s the outsider mindset. That’s what you need to really GET media. So here:

He hands me a piece of paper with nigh illegible handwriting on both sides. 

(PCPG) House of leaves? K-On? What is this?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, ConfusedMED) A list.

(PCPG) Yeah I can see that but a list of what?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMAX) Media recommendations. I’m not forcing you to consume all of that, of course. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMAX) Not sure I’d even be allowed to, but you really should have a look at every single thing on that list. It’s some great shit.

(PCPG) So what? I start reading and you just sit there? Even if it’s a light novel, reading the whole thing will take a while.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, smittenMED) I could read it to you...? 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, smittenMED) All of the dialogue is permanently etched into my mind anyways and years of lecturing have definitely improved my delivery.

(PCPG) I’m not a child.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, ConfusedMIN) Is that a “no”?

(PCPG) N-no. That sounds kind of nice actually.

Paragraphs and chapters fly by as professor Digibro puts all of his soul into performing every single character, employing some truly ridiculous voices in the process. 

No word feels like it is merely read off of a page. Every pause is deliberate. At first I assumed that being read to would be creepy as hell, but it’s honestly kind of comfy.

After finishing a chapter Digi speaks up.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMAX) So, what do you think of Boogiepop?

(PCPG) It’s great! That list must be a fucking treasure trove if this is anything to go by.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, smittenMIN) R-really? It’s pretty dense on your first read, I’m glad you liked it.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, smittenMIN) I was thinking that maybe you and I could hang again sometime. 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 1, smittenMIN) I... I could recommend you some more books... an... and maybe I could get to know you some more...

My heart is pounding out of my chest. Have I finally found someone I can call a friend or maybe even... something more? 

I look Digi in the eyes and see my reflection in his sunglasses.

(PCPG) Y... yeah, I’d like that.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 2, HappyMED) Good, I’m glad.

I feel myself being enraptured by the warmth of Digi’s smile. My face feels warm as it begins to redden like a tomato.

But it’s strange. Even though we didn’t talk very much, I still relish in Digi’s company.

[fade from black]

This is the kind of school I’ve always dreamed of! A whole class dedicated to memes? Seems like the internet is finally old enough now to get a break into our educational system.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, happyMED|shades, offleft, slide, center) ...and that’s why y’all got to eat your greens goddammit! Greens and beans and an effective workout routine, that’s what you need to get a godly build like yours truly! Just listen to me and I can guide you all on your way to the TOP!

I think I get it now! Basically, this is Professor Bestman's weekly outlet to tell his students why he’s a genius. Or rather why he thinks he is one.

(PCPG) But what has this all got to do with memes? 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, happyMIN|shades) Oh, dear student, that’s easy: Where do you think most of my memes come from! From being a legendary fitboy! Obviously. /n
So, any further questions regarding the topics for this course?

[SFX: PCP-AMBIENT_Classroom]
The entire classroom falls into a noisy chaos, pens and books fly through the air, everybody tries to make their opinion or joke heard. Some 4-channers and Redditors get into a violent argument about who has the better memes.

On my left, I hear a quite purple voice trying to speak up.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and the bearded socialist storms into the classroom.

And before saying anything else, he runs out again. 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) Yes, Mage?

(Mage, campus, 4, happyMIN, offleft, slide, left)

(Mage) I was wondering: Can we talk about dreams here? I think that’s a fascinating topic!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, angryMED|shades) Mage, you wanting to talk about dreams is a meme that needs to fucking die! What in the world could you have to say about dreams that is so interesting?!

(Mage, campus, 2, angryMED) I like them!

She sounds very dedicated.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, confusedMIN|shades) I see what you’re saying. But I still think dreams are an uninteresting topic to the broader classroom demographic.
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, confusedMIN|shades) What do you think class? Wouldn’t that be incredibly boring?
[CHOICE]

(PCPG) I don’t see what’s so bad about dreams Prof. Bestman. Aren’t they able to tell us things about ourselves that we are too cowardly to think about? Aren’t dreams an important tool for self-improvement? So that we can self-reflect on our inner well-being?

(Mage, campus, 1, happyMED)
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, angryMIN|shades) Well I hear what you’re saying, but at the same time, I don’t care, fuck you. I expected a better opinion from you PCPG!

Welp. Seems like I’m still good at ruining the relationship with my teachers real fast. Nothing has changed.

[SLIDE Mage offright]

The professor then goes on for a while about the art of creating reusable meme templates with a green screen, but it sounds pretty stupid and cringeworthy and I don’t care.

(Mage, campus, 5, smittenMIN) Thanks for supporting me back there PCPG.

Blood rushes to my face at the compliment. Why wouldn’t I support her there? The topic seemed really important to her.

(PCPG) N-No problem Mage!

(Mage, campus, 3, angryMIN) I have fought for my right to talk about dreams for years now, but you are the first person who actually seems interested.

(PCPG) I would really like to hear about your dreams! Maybe you can tell me about them in the cafeteria today?

(Mage, campus, 1, shockMIN) Uhh that would be cool! But uhh, I have a student council meeting during the lunch break. Maybe we can meet tomorrow on the school roof?

(PCPG) Wait, you can actually go on the rooftop of this school during the breaks? What is this, an anime?

(Mage, campus, 2, happyMED) Close enough. I’ll meet you there then, and don’t forget to bring your dream diary!

Man, I am pretty tired.

The class ended uneventfully after that whole dream debacle.

It’s true that nobody cares about other people's dreams, but it’s not like I’m as fervently [i]anti[/i]-dream as Professor Bestman is.

I sit down at a nearby table and lay my head down on my arms.

Professor Bestman sure is a passionate guy. He’s not content to let life just wistfully go by. He’s always pushing himself and others to strive for greatness.

Basically the complete opposite of me...

Oh well. Some people are just born like that I guess. Can’t be helped.

Professor Munchy decided to end our morning class early today, and soon I found myself conversing with two of the most powerful people in the school.

(Munchy, campus, default, happyMIN, center, slide, right)
(Ben, campus, base, neutral, left) Yo Munchy, done with your class for today?

(Munchy, campus, crossing, happyMED) Hell yeah my dude, we can totally fuck around.

(PCPG) Wait, you guys are actually friends? Aren’t you two literally in the middle of a WAR with each other?

(Ben, campus, exasp, confusedMIN) Well yeah, how else are you supposed to show affection for one another if not by brutally murdering each other's loyal subjects?

(Munchy, campus, crossing, happyMIN) Yeah, I wouldn’t have it any other way bro.

(Ben, campus, base, neutral) Me too man.

(PCPG) I see...

I thought these two were out for each other’s throats, but I guess it’s more about fucking each other over in some kind of high-minded game of chess, with each gang member serving as their pawns. Interesting...

The atmosphere gets awkward for a second so I try and strike something up.

(PCPG) So uh, Ben, you used to travel, if I recall?

(Ben, campus, base, neutral) Yeah, I used to actually like have a life and travel a lot when I was younger.

(Munchy, campus, crossing, confusedMIN) So how [i]did[/i] you go from world-traveling physics teacher to local homeless man?

(Ben, campus, slouch, neutral) Oh, y’know, pathetically.

(Munchy, campus, default, happyMED) Yeah, I figured. As for myself, I’m kind of done wandering around for now. This city and it’s people are enough to keep me entertained.

(Munchy, campus, squatting, happyMAX) On that note, the fight in the lunchroom today? Man, that shit was SICK. 

(Ben, campus, base, happyMIN) Totally man...

(Ben, campus, base, happyMAX) Hey Munchy, I have an idea.

(Munchy, campus, squatting, confusedMED) Huh? What do you mean?

(Ben, campus, point, neutral) Come over here, I’ll fill you in. It’s about Endless War.

They both get close to one another, and after about a minute of whispering, Munchy starts to speak.

(Munchy, campus, crossing, smittenMAX) AHEM. Speaking of Endless War, you know there was a moment in my life where I thought I went gay for good, but when I first saw her run for student council president, that all changed.

Wait, Endless War is the student council president?! How is this the first time I hear of this?

(Ben, campus, base, happyMIN) Man, I totally get you. You know what [i]I[/i] would do to Endless War? 

(PCPG) Hold on guys, isn’t this a bit weird, talking about her like this. Don’t you guys have any dignity?

Munchy starts whispering into my ear.

(Munchy, campus, crossing, angryMIN) [i]Act natural kid, this is just to draw her out. You don’t think we were gonna let you fucking chicken out while we have the chance, do you?[/i]

(PCPG) ...what?

(Munchy, campus, default, happyMIN)
(Ben, campus, point, happyMAX) I would first take her out on a dinner date. I would romance her and take her back to my high rise bungalow. I would then neg the shit out of her, and tell her that her dad was right all along and that she would never amount to anything, and that no self-respecting man would want her, and then I would pull out my gun and unload clip after clip into her, as she deserves.

[StopMusic]
(Endless War, cross, neutral, center) ...

(Munchy, campus, crossing, smittenMED) Wow Ben, racist much???

(Endless War) ...

(Endless War, knife, angryMED) Well fuck you too Ben. You’re lucky I like you, or else this knife would have ended your miserable fucking life right then and there. Don’t you dare talk shit about me ever again, because I WILL kill you.

[Song: PCPDating_BotBustah]
(Endless War, stand, neutral) Anyways, any new blood worthy of participating in the WAR?

(Munchy, campus, crossing, neutral) Nah, most of these new students can’t possibly fathom anything better than actually studying at this school, and then failing to do so. This kid right here though? He’s got potential.

(Endless War, stand, confusedMIN) Wait a second, you’re that pathetic fuck that ran away from the WAR a couple days ago. Have you finally decided to leave behind your purposeless life and join the cause?

Endless War gives me a menacing look.

(PCPG) Uhh... sure?

(Endless War, knife, confusedMAX) Don’t fucking just say “sure” like a retard, are you a Rowdy Fucker or a Cop Killer? Choose already!

(K1P|???, Neutral, left) Does he, though? Let’s be honest here, the only reason we’re lacking in recruits is because we fail to get to them before the Rowdys do. Thank God that isn’t the case this time.

(Munchy, campus, squatting, sadMIN, right) Ugh, God, not you people. The last thing I need today is a headache from hearing you prattle on about whatever bullshit low-IQ individuals such as TOP KILLERS do.

[K1P leaves]
(Magicks|???, Neutral, left) i wouldn’t worry about it. just go back to uh, doing whatever you were doing at the treehouse or something.

(Crocs|???, Angry) Yeah right, you Killers can’t fool me. I think I smell something strange, something INNOCENT and PURE-HEARTED in this room.

Two reptilian appendages sprout from his shoulders in a way that words fail to describe, as he also somehow procures a cowboy hat. This metamorphosis is so bizarre that I fail to register that... he has a gun pointed right at me!

(Crocs|???, special_outfit) A juvenile, huh. Just what the doctor ordered.

(Munchy, campus, crossing, neutral, right) Wait, hold on, don’t shoot. This guy could prove to be useful. He may even want to join the ranks and become a Rowdy Runt.

(Crocs|???, Neutral) Damn, whatever you say, boss.

[Crocs leaves]
[Munchy leaves]
(Schrafft|???, Neutral, center) Aaannnyywayyys, back to the main point of discussion here. Join the Killers. I’m begging you. We’re so low on reserves, I have to fucking cheat just to get by every once in a while.

(Magicks|???, Neutral) no, you really don’t.

(Schrafft|???, Neutral) Okay, discussion for another time then.

(Ephraim|???, Neutral, right) Forget about that for a sec and just ask yourself this: what would HONESTLY lead someone to become a Rowdy, when being a Killer is so much cooler? We hang out in a cathedral, we disregard law enforcement, and we’re just generally superior to those bustahs in every single way you could imagine.

(PCPG) Well, when you say it like that...

[Schrafft leaves]
(Crocs|???, Happy, center) HOLD IT! I think what my good pal Ephraim here fails to mention is that the ROWDYS are in fact the superior gang. Have you even seen our fucking base before? It’s a YMCA with subwoofers out the wazoo, and more game consoles than you would even know what to do with!

(Crocs|???, Neutral) Plus, we’re just more fun-loving and eccentric in general. The amount of artists and loremasters that the Rowdys have ON TOP of us just having more soldiers to send into the line of fire should make the choice obvious. Pretty much every Killer these days is just a retarded goon who has no concept of culture.

(Smearg|???, Neutral, offleft, slide, left-170) [i]I’m right here, y’know.[/i]

[SLIDE Smearg offleft]
[Smearg leaves]
(Crocs|???, Neutral) You’re an exception to the rule is what you are. Need I remind these gentlemen how many top killers have fallen off the face of the earth.

(Ephraim, Neutral) No need to rub salt in the wound. Just another thing the Rowdys fail at: achieving the moral victory. I doubt you’ll find people as barbaric as Crocs in our ranks.

(Crocs, Neutral) Yeah, and that’s a bad thing.

[Magicks leaves]
(K1P|???, Neutral, left) God, will y’all just shut up for once!

(K1P|???, Neutral) Seriously though, Schrafft and Eph are right. We could use someone like you to even the odds, and restore the Killers to their former glory. It would make things much more interesting if you sided with the underdogs, right? Seems like joining the Killers is a good effort towards game balance, if you ask me.

[Ephraim leaves]
(Munchy, campus, squatting, angryMED, right) Enough yapping, you freaks. Me and Ben just wanted to chill out, and then you all had to go ahead and ruin it. I say we should let PCPG decide for himself. Go on, get the fuck out of here.

Suddenly a purple light begins to envelop and circle around me and a near infinite amount of memories and experiences suddenly flash before my eyes. The light then calms down again, and at the end of it all, I feel like a changed man.
[CG end]

(PCPG) So what the fuck just happened?

(Ben, campus, base, neutral) Eh, enlisting does that to you. You just sold your soul to us, so the transaction kinda fucks with you a little. It gives you access to things you’ve never experienced before, allows you to peer into the reality of space and slime. It essentially turns you…

(Ben, campus, point, neutral) It also sets some restrictions on your actions. As a Killer you can no longer work on a farm and can only dangerously mine at night.

As I enter the cafeteria I look over at the mud puddle and notice Gibbon’s unmistakable cloud of hair. 

Actually, now that I think about it, I haven’t seen Gibbon for a couple days now, why is that? I mean of course I wasn’t going to have the exact same schedule as his like my first day here, but I imagined I would run into him at least once more. How strange.

After grabbing the cheapest thing off the menu that wasn’t keto pizza, I make my way towards his table.

(PCPG) Hey Gibbon!

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, happyMED) Oh, hey there mein frère. How’s it going?

(PCPG) Finally starting to feel like I belong, you know? How’s it going with you?

Gibbon gingerly presses his fingers together as he formulates an answer.

(Gibbon, campus, press, confusedMED) Ohhhh you know me, just jukin’ and jivin’, as I always do.

(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMAX|blush) But enough about me! Do you have any favourite classes yet?

(PCPG) Honestly, I was kinda surprised with how much I’m enjoying music class. I’m still not sure about the teacher, but I never really considered music before, and it’s pretty fun so far.

*City Park*

(Gibbon, campus, grabby, happyMIN) Well, uh, my offer still stands for you to come visit my place. Say, tonight? I have a few guitars and a drum set, we could jam a little?/n

On my way through the endless, confusing web of corridors that the PCPU consists of, a flyer catches my eye. 

The bright green and purple piece of paper announces the upcoming student council election but doesn’t give much information beyond that.

It’s not like I’m expecting a full-fledged campaign, but the fact that I don’t even know who’s running is kind of odd. 

Wasn’t Mage the vice president? Maybe I should ask her about the candidates.

The door sign ahead of me reads “Computer Lab,” and inside I see a familiar silhouette clacking away at a keyboard.

(Tom, 1, sadMAX)

(PCPG) Hey, how’s it going?

(Tom, 2, angryMAX) Awful, I’ve been sitting here for hours, trying to get this code to work and it’s just not fucking working. Look at this, why isn’t it executing properly?

He points to a wall of brackets and commands, that I vaguely understand to be... 

...programming gibberish. Yeah, no, not understanding any of that stuff. Why doesn’t this university have an IT course?

(PCPG) Okaaaay, well, what’s it supposed to do?

(Tom, 3, confusedMAX) It should change the way in which enemies respawn, but right now it just makes them not spawn at all and probably causes a bunch of other issues that I haven’t even noticed yet.

(PCPG) So if you deleted it, it would work again, right?

(Tom, 4, confusedMIN) Well yeah, unless there’s something else wrong entirely, but it would also wipe away hours of work and I’d still have to figure out how to do this.

He stares at the code again, while taking a gulp from a huge bottle of beige goop, before suddenly jerking forward and typing another line of characters.

The program compiles.

(Tom, huel, angryMIN) Fuck, if this was the only problem, I’m gonna fucking kill myself.

(PCPG) What did you do?

(Tom, huel, angryMAX) My human logic just keeps assuming that things are obvious, and not specifying them, when that’s clearly necessary for a machine.

(PCPG) Wouldn’t that be more of a problem with computer logic being weirdly obtuse than with human logic?

(Tom, 3, shockedMAX) No, because that’s actual logic instead of communicative bullshit, that leaves room for misunderstanding and is worse in every conceivable way. 

(Tom, 3, happyMIN) Upload me to the cloud any day, I wanna be a cyber god.

(PCPG) Well you’re sure as fuck closer to that goal than me. I haven’t even greeted the world of techno babble with a warm “hello,” so color me impressed by whatever this is you’re doing.

(Tom, 1, happyMIN) It’s not that hard, really. I always thought I was too dumb for this shit, and I am, but if you just do it, you’ll eventually get the hang of it. 

(Tom, 1, happyMIN) There’s actually this great book called “Learn Python the hard way,” if you’re interested.

(PCPG) Sure, maybe I’ll look into it, but I’m having trouble believing that you are too stupid for anything, mister ex-professor programmer guy.

Tom, unwilling to just accept the compliment, reaches for his milkshake-looking drink again.

(Tom, 4, sadMIN) That’s really nothing to be impressed by. 

(Tom, 4, sadMIN) You pretty much just have to be at the right place at the right time and maybe not completely braindead to become a professional ponyfag. 

(Tom, huel, angryMIN) There’s enough fuckers on the spectrum who will eat that shit up.

(PCPG) I really feel like you’re being too hard on yourself, but sure, if you don’t want credit for that, I’ll shut up about it. 

(PCPG) What is that Huel-stuff you’re drinking by the way? And don’t tell me it’s wine.

(Tom, huel, confusedMIN) Nah, only alcoholic beverages are wine, this is post-food lunch. 

(Tom, huel, confusedMIN) Besides, people look at you weirdly, when you tell them that you’re substituting meals with wine.

(PCPG) I’m guessing this is more weird transhumanism.

(Tom, huel, happyMIN) In part, sure, but there’s also pragmatism to it. The stuff is relatively inexpensive and most importantly makes it so you don’t have to cook.

(Tom, huel, angryMIN) Because cooking takes fucking time and why would I want to waste precious hours on just keeping my body from dying.

(PCPG) Pretty sure that’s not a healthy way of looking at food as a concept.

(Tom, huel, neutral) I don’t really care if it’s healthy. You better believe I will min-max the shit out of my life to spend more time on art. Plus it tastes alright.

(PCPG) Just saying, it seems like a lot of these nutrition supplements are scams at best and straight up poison at worst.

(Tom, huel, neutral) What should I say, to me that’s a risk worth taking, and it hasn’t killed me so far.

The code has finished compiling and Tom rubs his hands in anticipation.

(Tom, 4, sadMIN) God, I hope this worked.

I lean back in my chair, suddenly realizing that I still don’t exactly know what it is that he’s working on.

(PCPG) You said something about enemies spawning, so is this some kind of mod that you’re coding or...?

(Tom, 2, confusedMAX) Wait, I didn’t even tell you? Fuck, this is marketing 101: Tell people what you’re making and what your deal is twenty-four fucking seven. 

(Tom, 2, angryMIN) And second of all, how dare you insult me by implying that this is some derivative bullshit like a mod? 

(Tom, 2, angryMIN) I’m working on a 100% genuine one-man indie game here and it’s fucking dope.

(PCPG) Should I just abandon that front all together, or is this something you’ll accept compliments for at least?

(Tom, 1, happyMAX) Not before you’ve actually seen the game and told me what sucks dick about it. After that, it’s up for consideration.

(PCPG) So what’s your game about? Sell me on it.

(Tom, 1, happyMAX) It’s an action platformer, centered around a cute raccoon-ninja-girl and her bloodthirsty sword slicing up monsters and generally being edgy, 

(Tom, 1, happyMAX) but in the cool way, hopefully. 

(Tom, 2, happyMIN) Wanna check it out?

I want to say yes, but a quick glance at the clock reveals that I really should be heading to class right about now.

(PCPG) I’d love to, that sounds cool as hell, but I really have to make a run for the classroom if I don’t want Professor Bestman to dismantle me on atomic level.

(Tom, 1, sadMIN) Oh, sure. Well, it shouldn’t be too hard to find me if you’re in the mood for some playtesting.

(PCPG) Sounds great, bye!

With that, I sprint out into the hallway, before realizing that I don’t have any idea how to get to class from here.

(PCPG) You don’t happen to know which direction the Science class is...?

(Tom, huel, neutral) Go left, then turn right at the blue lockers, take the stairs and from there on just follow the increasing room numbers.

(PCPG) Huh, thanks. Why is this school’s layout such a labyrinthine clusterfuck anyways?

(Tom) If I had to guess, I’d say that it’s a metaphor for the artistic process... most things are around here, but didn’t you say you were in a hurry?

(Tom, 4, happyMIN) It’s preferable. Here you go.

The game starts up with lightning flashing and a 3d model of the titular racoon-girl attacking the screen with a katana.

(PCPG) Whoa, who made that intro model?

(Tom, huel, confusedMIN) I take offense to your assumption that I didn’t make all of this myself. Which admittedly I didn’t, the music was outsourced.

(PCPG) I guess I just don’t assume that everyone’s a weird art-polymath.

(Tom, 1, smittenMIN) Well, you have to be. It’s the indie lifestyle. Now play the fucking game!

(PCPG) Alright, alright.

[Location: computerlab]

I press X, the music starts up and I find myself in an alleyway.

(PCPG) So, what are my controls?

(Tom, 1, neutral) Dude, there’s LITERALLY writing on the wall. You ARE going to perish, but it also tells you what the buttons do. We in the industry call this kinda thing game design.

(PCPG) Well fuck you too. 4/10, the gorgeous sprite work distracts from the instructions on screen.

(Tom, 3, angryMIN) Barely a minute in, and already there’s some garbage score and a bullshit justification for it. This is the fucking problem with game-journalism.

(PCPG) You don’t get to make that joke. I’m literally playing as a strong female character who isn’t sexualized in the slightest.

(Tom, 3, happyMIN) Oh no, my hubris has come to bite me in the ass once again. The broad market appeal of my product is preventing me from making shitty Gamergate references.

He waits for a bit until I pass the large metal gate, before exclaiming in perfect unison with the announcer voice:

(Tom, 1, happyMAX) Revolt!

(PCPG) So, am I supposed to find an exit or something?

(Tom, huel, happyMAX) Nah, just kill everything in your path. You know, like a ninja.

A few attempts, and the occasional frustrated noise from Tom later, I finally make it to the end.

(PCPG) Whoo, fucking amazing, this was way worth skipping meme class for!

(Tom, 3, shockedMAX) You didn’t tell me that. Nate is gonna kill you on sight if he finds out.

(PCPG) Yeah, well fuck academia. You obviously don’t give a shit and you made all of this. So honestly, what good is this school really?

(Tom, 3, shockedMAX) Don’t put me in a position where I have to defend this shit, but the connections are useful for one thing. 

(Tom, 3, shockedMAX) There’s a reason why I’m trying not to get kicked out of this place after all.

(PCPG) They won’t kick you, if you make yourself big enough of a deal, and without trying to blow smoke up your ass or anything: Azumi is big deal material.

(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Still, that takes a shitload of marketing for anyone who isn’t an insane genius or ridiculously lucky. 

(Tom, 1, shockedMIN) I’m neither and I have to work on my project, learn the skills to complete it, and market it simultaneously, which is just... 

(Tom, 1, sadMAX) ...a lot. Especially if time is running out.

(PCPG) Well, you didn’t have a marketing assistant before, did you?

(Tom, 2, confusedMAX) Yeah right. Look, I appreciate the thought, but you should try not to miss whatever the next class you have is. 

(Tom, 2, sadMAX) Being responsible for my own fuckups is about as much as I can deal with and I really don’t want to be responsible for yours as well.

Davoo raises his hand to make one such inquiry. I hadn’t noticed him sitting there.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, angryMIN) Just about taking people seriously without being condescending and pretending to know that a point is bad before even having heard it.

(PCPG) Yeah, that was a bit shitty. Well, the autonomous particle thing sounded interesting, if a little esoteric.

(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) Sure, if I find the article again, I’ll show it to you. Anyways, where are you heading?

Davoo seems really uncomfortable addressing the issue any further. 

Something is definitely going on, but it’s probably in the best interest of our developing friendship to restrain my curiosity for now.

(PCPG) I could go for some food right about now. Wanna come grab a bite?

(Davoo, campus, neutral, confusedMIN) Sure, well, depends. You’re not gonna drag me to some restaurant, right?

(PCPG) I don’t quite have the funds for that, with my tuition money being funneled to the top of some multi-level marketing operation. 

(PCPG) I mean, do you get dragged to restaurants frequently?

(Davoo, campus, neutral, neutral) Digi is a strange employer.

(PCPG) I was just thinking cafeteria. Guess that solves the mystery of why I never see you there.

He hands over the five PCPennies one would be expected to pay for the meal, before winking at the cafeteria lady and adding another three. 

The woman doesn’t respond beyond a confused look.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) This is [i]the premium[/i].

Judging from her facial expression, Davoo’s explanation was of no help whatsoever, but she hands him his meal anyway. 

This doesn’t seem like the kind of place where you would tip people, though from how Davoo said it, it’s pretty clear that he believes the nature of [i]the premium [/i]to be self-evident.

I step forward to order, and as my gaze wanders across the array of absurd to absurdly normal offerings, 

I become momentarily transfixed by the gigantuan chunk of raw, bloody beef called the “real meat”. 

Not sure if anyone actually eats this stuff or if it’s more of an art exhibit. 

If it serves any purpose whatsoever, that purpose is to call the nature of all other animal products on the menu into question. 

What are they if not “real meat”? The thought of ordering it briefly pops into my mind before being drowned out by much more sensible thoughts 

about not being able to afford it and not being willing to, nor capable of devouring five pounds of uncooked beef. 

(Cafeteria Lady) If you’re not going to order, step aside.

(PCPG) Oh, sorry, I’ll also take the chicken.

We find some seats that aren’t the subject of various territorial disputes between rival gangs, which still isn’t the easiest thing, but I’ve gotten better at it since my first day here.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMIN) He holds a lot of lectures in comparison to the other professors, human content machine and all that, 

(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMIN) but it’s really worthwhile to listen to all of them to get the bigger picture and get into the mindset to understand where he’s coming from, you know?

(PCPG) Turns out that taking every single course at a university, and actually attending all classes is physically impossible, so I have to skip out on a few.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, shockMAX) Every class? Lol, you’re a lot more driven than you let on... Damn. I’ll keep you updated on the important points then.

Ha ha, me and academically driven. Seems like I’ll have to crush his perception of my work ethic...

...or do I?

The narrative stakes of the choice presenting itself could hardly be any higher, though I don’t quite know what “narrative” is supposed to mean in this context.

Seeing how the decision in need of making is unmistakably real and I am about to face full life consequences for the way in which I proceed.

I should probably just keep walking. He kinda creeps me out. Then again... gah, why is this the one thing I’m NOT too lazy and introverted to do?

(PCPG) Hey, uhh... you okay there?

(Jesse, special, 3, sadMIN)
Oh God he's looking at me. Help. Why did I think this was a good idea?

(PCPG) I... I have half a Huel bar going spare. Not really my kinda thing, too protein-y. You want it?

(Jesse, special, 2, happyMED)
Quicker than the human eye, he scurries up to me and swipes the bar out of my outstretched hand. I can't even tell if he takes the wrapper off before scarfing it down!

(Jesse|???, special, 5, happyMED) Hoo boy, that sure hit the spot! Not that I’m the biggest fan of these non-food foods. No non-food food is ever gonna beat a food food in this froody foodie’s opinion. But it does make me feel like I'm at least 20% less dead, which is all I ever want these days.

(PCPG) Not in the sewers, but...

(Jesse, special, 4, shockedMIN) Look buddy, if you're offering a couch to crash on, forget it. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it, but you can't go around letting random bums into your house. Put it this way, I wouldn't trust me, so why should you?

He has a point. I've barely met the guy, and already I'm inviting him over to sleep? Heh, if only I could be that gung-ho with my crushes.

(PCPG) Well, then I'll stay out here with you! I don't feel comfortable knowing you're out here on your own...

(Jesse, special, 5, neutral) Nope, I'm putting my foot down. Straight down, like the lightning bolt of Zeus thrown down from the heavens to pierce the heart of an earthly maiden below.

(Jesse, special, 5, angryMIN) Go home and sleep tight in your bed. It's not just a right, but a moral obligation of everyone with a comfy bed to make full use of it! Otherwise you're wasting it, and that's the worst sin of all.

(Jesse, special, 5, angryMED) The eighth deadly sin of man, wasting comfy beds. Even Satan wouldn't do that. He's tucked up with a warm blankey and a glass of milk every night and you know it, because he appreciates the gifts he’s got. I think the kids these days call that "checking your privilege."

(PCPG) Can't argue with that. How about this then, I'll come back tomorrow morning on the way to school. Deal?

(Jesse, special, 1, happyMED) Now THAT, I can get behind. Catch you later, alligator./n
Thanks for the food and goodnight!

[Scene: The Day of Retribution]

I better get back home soon though, this day was definitely long enough.

As I stumble my way through the dark alleyway I begin to ruminate on my time here at PCPU. Honestly, I don’t quite feel like I’ve gotten to know anyone here quite as much as I wanted to.

I guess it was clear from the beginning. I’m too damn autistic to make any meaningful connections in this school. I found a few friendships, but I always wanted more than just friendships...

I mean really, don’t I deserve more?

Holy fuck! Did I fall through a trapdoor or something.. into this.. basement?

(Mumkey Jones, body, blank, offright, slide, center)
(Geoff|???, default, neutral, offleft, slide, left) Uhh Mumkey, I’m... I’m not comfortable with this...

(Mumkey Jones) Shut up weeb, we already invested all your precious Naruto Online dollars into these guns. There’s no backing out now!

(Mumkey Jones) So, you’re an outcast like us huh? A loser, a loner? Nobody wanted to come up to you and offer you their love? Or perhaps you refused what measly things they did have to offer? 

(PCPG) ...

(Mumkey Jones) No matter. My friend, I think you’ll be happy to hear that you are not alone!

(Mumkey Jones) Me and Mr. Anime Pope over here are also outcasts from the PCPU! In fact, we’re in the middle of planning our revenge...

(Mumkey Jones) Now you’re probably wondering: But Muuumkeyyy, what have these poor people even done to you to deserve such a cruel fate?

(PCPG) I wasn’t about to as-

(Mumkey Jones) WELL I’M GLAD YA ASKED, allow me to tell you the tragic tale of Mumkey Jones, once a celebrated student at the Pro Crastinators University, now expelled, homeless, cancelled, and on a quest for vengeance!

The monkey man starts telling me his story. It at first just sounds like pathetic whining, but after a while I begin to empathize and even.. sympathize with him.

(Geoff|???, default, smug) Or, you know, you could simply take the fact that you were expelled with grace, like me!

(Mumkey Jones) Well you were kicked just cause you’re just a boring shill. I excelled at the classes, they just didn’t see my true brilliance for what it’s worth, so don’t you dare compare yourself to me!

[SFX: PCP-SFX_Gunshot]
(Geoff, dead, blank, left, slide, offleft)
(PCPG) Holy shit Mumkey, what the fuck! Wasn’t he your friend?!

(Mumkey Jones) Ah don’t worry about it. He’ll be back soon enough. 

(Mumkey Jones) All you need to know is that this world is one truly twisted, and every waking moment is unjustly filled with agony for those who are like us! I know you must feel similar.

(PCPG) I mean... I guess so.

(Mumkey Jones) Haven’t you ever wanted to get revenge on the people who hurt you? Haven’t you ever wanted to hurt them back? Show them the pain they caused you?

(PCPG) Well... sometimes, I suppose.

(Mumkey Jones) Then it is decided! Let’s shoot up this stupid facade of a university!

(PCPG) Woah what?

(Mumkey Jones) Don’t think about it too hard! Just shoot up this school with me!

(PCPG) Yeah?

(Mumkey Jones) Yeah!

(PCPG) Yeaaah! Let’s fucking do it!
