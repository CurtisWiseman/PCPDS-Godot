It happened again. I fell asleep in class.

Specifically, I fell asleep in class [i]yesterday[/i] and didn’t find out until later that there was a handout I was supposed to collect from the desk on the way out.

I’m already getting bad grades in Professor Bestman’s class, and now I don’t even have the handout necessary to do the assignment due tomorrow.

(PCPG) Gotta get that handout.

[Location: pcpgbathroom]

There’s no way around it. I’m going to have to ask Professor Bestman for it directly...

[fade to black]

[Location: 7eleven.day]

[fade from black]

I walk out of the 7-Eleven with my Bang Energy in hand. In my thoughtful stupor, I didn’t even pay attention to what specific flavor I purchased.

I still don’t pay attention as I open it and take a sip. It tastes like...

[Choice]
*Rainbow Unicorn*
*Soy*

*Rainbow Unicorn*
Ha! I wish it was Rainbow Unicorn. Of course it’s fucking soy!
*

*Soy*
It tastes like soy. Damn it.
*

I’d better make sure not to eat any tofu for a while. These phytoestrogens will fuck you up. It’s a shame it tastes so good though.

I found myself pro crastinating the meeting with Professor Bestman by taking a detour for refreshment.

I should probably head over now…

I’m finally in. Now just to figure out the location of his office. I think I recall it being on the second floor. Or maybe it was--

[StopMusic]

(Nate|???, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offleft) Yo! PCPG!

[i]chills[/i]

(Nate|???, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offleft) I thought your sorry ass would be comin’ ’round here!

I’m scared, but I turn around.

[Song: PCPDating_ClassPhilosophy]

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offleft, slide, center) What’s up, bud?

I say nothing.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) Hello?!

I start to speak up meekly.

(PCPG) I’m sorry… I think.. that .. I forgot to…


(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, angryMIN|shades) Have some confidence in yourself, man!

(PCPG) ...

(PCPG) Really sorry about... this…

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, angryMED|shades) I know what you’re here for!

Does he?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) You’re here for the handout you missed, aren’t you?

How could he possibly know? I really [i]can’t[/i] escape this dude. He’s in my mind now!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, smittenMED|shades) It’s pretty hard to miss a kid sleeping through an entire lecture.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, smittenMIN|shades) Students like to think they’re being sly, but a teacher always knows what’s happening in their classroom!

Oh god.. the embarrassment!.. all these years.. all those teachers...

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades) I saw your ass trudge up from your seat at the end of the period. Naturally, you slept through my announcement of the necessary handout.

Well I guess the worst part is over. My sin is out on the table for all to see.

(PCPG) Yeah.. I’m really sorry about that, Professor Bestman…

(PCPG) I was wondering... if you had an extra copy of that handout I could borrow...

(Nate, campus, smoking, neutral|shades)

I stand silently waiting for the professor to speak. I try to match his eyeline.

(Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades)

But he’s staring right at me with no hesitation whatsoever.

(Nate, campus, standing, angryMIN|shades)

I look down at my feet…

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) Well, I already took those papers home, so I don’t have them with me.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, neutral|shades) They’re at my apartment.

(PCPG) I see. That’s too bad.

(PCPG) I’ll go home...  in that case...

No one can say that I didn’t try. Culpability remains at a zero. I start to turn around to leave.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) Woah there, dude! Hold on a second!

His sudden exclamation startles me and kick-starts my anxiety again.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, smittenMIN|shades) I don’t exactly like the idea of a student of mine losing an opportunity to learn and develop!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, angryMIN|shades) This assignment is pivotal to learning Plato’s base philosophy. And there’s plenty to gain from it on a personal level as well!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, smittenMED|shades) I’ve got a great idea on what we can do to solve this.

Lord, strike me down.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, angryMED|shades) YOU have got to come over to MY apartment!

[i]wut[/i]

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) To pick up the handout, of course!

Anxiety is at fever pitch.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades) I know it’s a little weird to be invited to a professor’s place of living, but we’ve got no choice here.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, smittenMED|shades) I’m not giving up on you so easily!

Too late. I’ve [i]already[/i] given up on myself.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades) I know what missing this assignment is going to mean for your grade. 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades) You, of all people, can’t afford to miss it.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) I really think you have it in you to turn this semester around.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, shockMIN|shades) I can tell you’re a smart kid!

I wish I could tell him that my own personal drive does not even match a tenth of [i]his[/i] drive on my behalf.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, confusedMIN|shades) Here, let me write down my address.

There’s no way I’m doing this. I have to refuse.

(PCPG) I’m sorry, professor… but unfortunat--

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, happyMED|shades) Here’s where I live!

He cuts me off by shoving a scrap of paper onto my chest.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, angryMED|shades) Meet me at 7pm! Don’t you dare be late.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, smittenMED|shades) Make sure to eat before you come.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, maniacal) Cuz I ain’t feedin’ yo’ ass!

(Nate, campus, maniacal, center, slide, offright)

I hear him laughing as he walks down the corridor toward the entrance of the school. What did I get myself into? I don’t deserve this. 

It looks like my adventure isn’t over quite yet. 

[StopMusic]

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, maniacal, offright) Hey! What the fuck!

I’m spooked by a sudden exclamation that I hear coming from all the way outside.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, maniacal, offright) Who’s the fucking soyboy who left this empty can on the floor!?

Oh no. He found my can! I dropped it on the ground since there were no trash cans outside...

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, maniacal, offright) Take some [b]personal[/b] [i]fucking[/i] [b]responsibility[/b], why dontcha!!

[Nate leaves]

[Song: PCPDating_FallenGlass]

Suddenly, I have no problem feeling guilty. Today has just been escalating gradations of shame and misery.

This sucks.

Why did nobody wake me up and just tell me about the handout yesterday? It wouldn’t have been hard.
 
I turn around and start heading down the hallway to leave.

[fade to black]

(PCPG) It’s not my fault.

[Location: waytoschool.night]

I finished another Soy Bang Energy that I got from the 7-Eleven. Yet again, there is no trash can in sight.

With a cavalier attitude, I toss the can on the ground beside me, and continue walking toward Nate’s apartment..

It’s 7:20pm. I was told to arrive at 7:00pm.

As with anything in life, there is a careful anxious battle between needing to act to prevent things from getting worse and a full-body recalcitrance freezing up my body.

I stand below the door frame to Professor’s Bestman’s place of living.

I raise my right hand and cock it in an appropriate fist as if about to knock.

I stand... cocked…

I stand, [i]cocked…….[/i]

[i]cocked…….[/i]

[i][b]cock…….[/b][/i]

[i][b]GO!!!![/b][/i]

[SFX: PCP-SFX_DoorKnock]

Of course, the amount of mental gymnastics necessary for even the most banal and mundane of everyday tasks is shameful.

…

He’s not answering?

Incredible ameliorating relief washes over my body as I continue to sense no movement from the caverns on the other side of the door. A gentle soothing and smoothing wave assuages the rough wrinkles of hot tension accumulated across my upper chest.

(PCPG) Fuck yes! He’s not in!!

An incredible realization, for no one could blame [i]me[/i] at this point for not being able to turn in the assignment. I did all I could.

I turn around and start walking.

(PCPG) I wonder what yummy snacks I have in the fridge at home.

[StopMusic]

(Nate|???, casual, standing, neutral, offleft) Yo! PCPG!

[i]fever pitch[/i]

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral, offleft, slide, center)

[Song: PCPDating_MoveMe]

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, neutral) Hey. What’s up, bud?

He’s looking [i]rather[/i] different. This is intimidating in [i]rather[/i] new way.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, confusedMIN) No worries. I knew you’d be coming in late. Come on in.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral, center, slide, offright)

Shuffling past me, he already has his keys out to open the door. Besides his keys, he seems to be clutching an empty can of sorts.

Wait. Did he just say he [i]knew[/i] I’d be late? I suddenly déjà vu some feelings that the professor was capable of mind reading me.

[SFX: PCP-SFX_DoorOpen]

[Location: nateroom]

We shuffle and shamble past his doorway and atrium, to arrive in what appears to be his bedroom.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, offright, slide, center) 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, neutral|shades) Make yourself comfortable.

The professor has put on his trademark shades. I meekly find an unassuming wooden chair in the corner of the room to sit in.

Surprisingly comfortable.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, center, slide, left)

I see him throw the empty can he was holding earlier into an appropriate recycling bin in his room.

*Toss the can on the ground.*
Suddenly, I feel really guilty about once again throwing that empty energy drink can on the ground earlier….

Professor Bestman very obviously held onto his refuse can until he had an opportunity to dispose of it properly.
*

*You’re Gonna Carry That Can*
Professor Bestman very obviously held onto his refuse can until he had an opportunity to dispose of it properly.

He sees you’re still carrying that empty can of energy drink from earlier.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, happyMIN|shades) Want me to get that for you?

I hand him the can.

(Nate, casual, smoking, confusedMIN|shades)

I pray that he doesn’t manage to read the label to see the Soy flavoring, especially since I know he accidentally ran into my previous shameful can of soy indiscretion earlier today.

He disposes of it in a similar fashion as to his own can.

Thankfully, he doesn’t seem to notice any malfeasance.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, smittenMED|shades) Good on you for holding onto that can and not littering, dude!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) Technically, the environment and climate change are the greatest problems humans have to overcome in the next few decades.
*

(Nate, casual, smoking, neutral|shades, left, slide, center)

The professor then leans against a bedpost. I start to consider what the professor said earlier about knowing that I’d arrive late...

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) Don’t act so surprised.

He sensed my surprise.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, smittenMED|shades) You’ve been my student for weeks at this point. I’m familiar with your attendance habitudes!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, confusedMIN|shades) You got here just before I arrived, didn’t you?

Although this should ultimately feel very shameful, his tone of voice helps mollify my concerns.

(PCPG) I’m really sorry Professor. I got distracted on the way ov--

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, happyMIN|shades) Don’t worry about it.

His tone allows me to start feeling comfortable not worrying about it.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, confusedMIN|shades) Hungry? Let me find you something to eat.

Didn’t he specifically say I should eat before I come? The more I think about what he said earlier today, the more it becomes plainly obvious that he was just joking.

I guess I was feeling a little [i]tense[/i] earlier.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades)

Professor Bestman opens a wooden cabinet he has in his room, doing that reveals a grand wash of canned beans.

He grabs two and pulls out a peculiar looking metal object from his pocket.

It seems to be some kind of small, portable, foldable blade. He senses my curiosity.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) This is a military can opener.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) When you’re eating enough of these canned beans, it just starts to make more sense than a traditional kitchen can opener.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) Higher skill ceiling with these. I can probably open two cans in under five seconds with this.

(Nate, casual, standing, confusedMAX|shades)

He proceeds to deftly open the two cans with little trouble. It takes seven seconds, though.

(Nate, casual, smoking, happyMED|shades)

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, happyMAX|shades) Hahahaha! 

Upon hearing the professor laugh, I find myself relaxing into my seat and my face easing of it’s tension.

(Nate, casual, smoking, happyMIN|shades)

I start looking less at my feet, and more at him directly. I smile shyly.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, shockMIN|shades) Alright, that took a little longer than expected.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, confusedMIN|shades) To be honest though, I just did like twenty minutes with the hand grips on the car ride over here.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, confusedMED|shades) So uhhhh, cut me some slack.

(Nate, casual, smoking, happyMIN|shades)

It’s a little shocking to hear the professor speak so casually and with such levity, but it puts me at ease.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) Honestly, the real reason I use these is because they’re badass!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, smittenMED|shades) They’re freaking manly as hell!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, confusedMED|shades) There’s no way I’d use those womanly, [i]domestic[/i], standard kitchen can openers!

I start to smile to myself imagining what it would be like for the professor to use a regular kitchen can opener.

He has a point.

(Nate, casual, pointing, neutral|shades)

He hands me an opened raw can of beans with an accompanying stainless-steel spoon. With his own spoon and beans, he starts diving into his [i]meal[/i].

Obviously, I have some personal reservations about consuming cold beans from a can, so I just meekly stir the contents with the spoon while watching the professor eat.

The professor continues confidently consuming the cold bean cuisine, seeming lost in thought as he stares off into a corner of the room. What is he thinking about?

I feel surprisingly at ease and comfortable. Normally I would feel pressure to contribute conversation, but it somehow seems appropriate to just relax in silence together.

It’s at this point that I notice some of the posters and decorations he has around his room.

Some are very weird, but what catches my attention are the variety of assorted pictures and posters of very buff men posing in what seems to be their underwear.

One of a big, bulky black dude especially catches my attention.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) That’s Ronnie Coleman.

The professor is done eating and has caught onto the direction of my gaze.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) Some consider him the greatest bodybuilder of all time.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades)

(PCPG) Bodybuilding, eh.

Is this what bodybuilding is? To be honest, I’ve never really personally distinguished the intricate differences between something like powerlifting and bodybuilding.

(Nate, casual, standing, confusedMIN|shades)

He seems to have caught onto my minor consternation.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, happyMED|shades) Yup! To be honest it is a bit of a niche interest. Especially with modern bodybuilding being more about straight shock value than anything else.

As I continue looking, there is another picture that strikes my interest, this time in black and white. I keep looking at the face of the man in the picture.

I swear I’ve seen this person before. It’s uncanny.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, smittenMED|shades) Hahaha! Don’t worry. Your brain isn’t deceiving you. That’s Arnie!

(PCPG) Arnie?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, smittenMAX|shades) Arnold Schwarzenegger!

It becomes overwhelmingly obvious that this handsome and fit man is a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) Yup! Most people know that Arnold comes from the fitness world, but maybe are not familiar with the intricacies of what he did back in the early 70s.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, smittenMIN|shades) Basically, he won the Mr. Olympia six times in a row.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, happyMED|shades) The Mr. Olympia is the biggest and most prestigious bodybuilding competition in the world. It has been occurring annually for a while, and continues to this day.

Wow. I guess Arnold really is a badass.

(PCPG) So how exactly is bodybuilding different from regular weight lifting?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, confusedMED|shades) Well, basically there’s two things one could do: Gain muscle for strength, or gain muscle for show.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, neutral|shades) Bodybuilders do the latter. This involves a focus on building muscle mass in an aesthetically-pleasing way.

(PCPG) Oh, I see.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, neutral|shades) Top-tier bodybuilders tend to look completely different from top-tier powerlifters.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, shockMED|shades) If you look at the people participating in the World’s Strongest Man powerlifting competition, you have to admit that sometimes they just look like big ol’ fat men.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) Don’t get me wrong, they have a crap ton of muscle.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) But since an excess of fat isn’t necessarily [i]hurting[/i] their lifts, they aren’t worried about keeping a low body fat percentage.

The way he’s explaining it is making it all clearer in my head. He takes a pensive pause before continuing.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, smittenMED|shades) What I like about bodybuilding is the incredible work ethic.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, neutral|shades) These men go through incredible strain and sacrifice year-round just for a chance to be crowned number one at the Mr. Olympia ever year.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, neutral|shades) As I said earlier, many consider Ronnie Coleman to be the king of bodybuilding, but he had to sacrifice so much to attain that.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, neutral|shades) He’s undergone several life-threatening surgeries because of the great strain he placed on his body over the years.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, sadMIN|shades) There’s been many times where it was questionable whether he’d even be able to walk on his own ever again.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, sadMIN|shades) ...

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) What’s really inspiring to me is that he doesn’t regret a single bit of it…

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, papers, neutral|shades) He’d gladly do it all again.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) He cemented his legacy and reached the top, and he sacrificed [i]everything[/i] to get there.

It’s obvious the professor is really passionate about this.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) sacrifice…

The professor trails off and starts staring into the far distance. Considering [i]something[/i] very ponderously. I feel as if it should probably be me who breaks the silence.

What do I think about the man, Ronnie Coleman, who sacrificed his life to become the greatest bodybuilder of all time?

[Choice]
*Ronnie Coleman is truly a deserved king among men.*
*Ronnie Coleman is a very stupid dude.*

*Ronnie Coleman is truly a deserved king among men.*
(PCPG) That’s incredible. I can’t even imagine the amount of willpower and discipline it took to reach that kind of status.

Professor Bestman seems to light up at my sympathetic passion.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, smittenMED|shades) Yes!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, pointing, happyMED|shades) He really is [i]The Best. Guy. Ever[/i]!
*

*Ronnie Coleman is a very stupid dude.*
(PCPG) What?!

(PCPG) What’s the point of reaching the top if you have to give up so much to do it?

(PCPG) Life should never be that hard. Life is about [i]enjoyment[/i], and none of what Ronnie Coleman did sounds enjoyable.

(Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|shades)

Unexpectedly, Professor Bestman seems to frown at my sudden exclamations.

For once, I feel like it’s [i]me[/i] who caught [i]him[/i] off guard. I think I may have gotten too comfortable.
*

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, neutral|shades) Well anyways…

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, neutral|shades) It’s getting late. I still have a bit of class planning to do before tomorrow.

(Nate, casual, papers, neutral|shades)

He reaches into a backpack on the floor and pulls out some papers.

(Nate, casual, pointing, neutral|shades)

He gently hands me a single piece.

[b]Handout Get![/b]

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, smoking, shockMIN|shades) Look, I know it’s already very late. I know the assignment is due tomorrow.

I look at my watch and see that it is now a little past nine. Two hours have passed since I first arrived.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, neutral|shades) Don’t worry about turning in the assignment tomorrow. Just give it to me next Monday.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, casual, standing, happyMIN|shades) You’ll have the whole weekend to do it. I don’t want you to rush this particular project.

(PCPG) Oh wow! Thank you, Professor Bestm--

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, smittenMED|shades) Just call me Nate!

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMED|shades)

The profess-- [i][b]Nate[/i][/b] is smiling. Confident and happy as ever.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, center, slide, offleft)

As he heads over to open the door to let me out, I place my uneaten can of beans on the floor beside me. I make my way out the door and into the cold evening air.

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offright, center)

Some time has passed since I had that incredible event with Nate at his apartment.

After he gave me an extension on the assignment, I actually managed to buckle down and get it in on time.

I’ve slowly made the habit of arriving to his class on time, and my grades are starting to reflect my newfound effort.

(Nate|Nate, campus, pointing, happyMED|shades, center, slide, left) Today we will be discussing the topic of [i]Willpower[/i]!

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) Hey Tom! Do you mind grabbing the W through X Volume of the [i]Urban Dictionary[/i] Encyclopedia?

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMIN, offright, slide, right) No problem, teach!

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) Great. I think it’s the 17th volume if I’m not mistaken.

(Tom, 1, angryMIN, right, slide, offright)

Ever since I started getting to class on time, I’ve noticed that Nate likes to begin by reading the [i]Urban Dictionary[/i] entry for whatever topic he is discussing that day.

(Tom, 1, angryMAX, offright, slide, right, 5)

Tom is shambling to the front of the classroom with the encyclopedia volume.

(Tom, 1, angryMAX, right, slide, center, 5)

He requires two appendages to schlep that huge, leather-clad book from the shelf in the back.

(Tom, 2, angryMIN)

Tom extends his arms outward as if presenting the book as an offering to the teacher. 

(Nate, campus, standing, smittenMED|shades)

Nate picks it up with no effort using only one hand.

(Nate, campus, papers, neutral|shades)$

(Tom, 1, neutral, center, slide, offright)

Tom goes back to his seat while Nate flips deftly to the appropriate page number.

[Tom leaves]

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, happyMED|shades, left, slide, center) Willpower: ‘Being able to do something difficult without cheating through it.’

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, neutral|shades) The example given is: ‘You have to have good willpower to go on a diet without breaking it.’

The mundane writing and uninspired message fails to impress me, but as always, Nate is incredibly fascinated.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) So wise…

Maybe there’s a secret allure in this banal writing that I just don’t understand. Maybe the simplest things in life hide within themselves the truest beauty..

…

I sober up out of my flowery thoughts when I look around at my classmates to see them as bored and disinterested as always.

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offright, center)

The next 2 hours and 45 minutes of the seminar proceeds with Nate discussing the history of willpower as a philosophical concept.

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, neutral|shades) To recap: We started with the concept of [i]ethos[/i] from Aristotle. We eventually got to the [i]id[/i] from Freudian theory.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) In today’s time, psychology researchers such as Roy F. Baumeister and John Tierney study and research the concept of self control and willpower as a limited, but renewable, quantitative pool of [i]energy[/i] in the body.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) Willpower can be trained and improved, as Baumeister and Tierney have shown.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) It is all about building good habits and maintaining a positive momentum!

(Nate|Nate, campus, pointing, happyMED|shades) [i]Anyone[/i] is capable of greatness.

I’ve had plenty of face time with Nate ever since I started taking a more active role in my education.

Later in the day, I arrive in the library for the discussion section. The same people as always are there.

Nate..

and Tom…

A few others have come and gone throughout the weeks, but only Tom and I have consistently come to every single discussion section.

(Tom, 3, angryMIN)

Tom is already getting started by reading some miscellaneous book.

I manage to take a glimpse at the title and see he is reading something called [i]The Handbook of Self-Regulation: Research, Theory, and Applications[/i].

Wow. Well it sure [i]sounds[/i] impressive.

(Tom, 1, neutral)$

(Nate|Nate, campus, pointing, happyMED|shades) Glad you could join us, PCPG!

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades)$

Over the next hour we sit, discuss, and review the topics we went over in class.

This started as a review session to get our grades up, but that changed as soon as Tom and I were doing just fine in terms of grades.

It’s turned into a guided independent study section of sorts. We now do advanced reading and discussion of the topics we comparatively skim over in class.

The next hour, filled with tedious yet enriching reading and discussion, goes by as usual.

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, happyMED|shades) Good work today, boys. I’ll see you next week!

(Tom|Tom, 3, smittenMIN) Well my friend, Brad Garlinghouse, recently told me that the door to the school roof doesn’t lock properly.

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMIN) I’ve been chilling there during lunch. It’s the coolest!

That actually does sound pretty cool.

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMAX) We should totally hang out on the roof sometime!

(Tom|Tom, 1, shockedMIN) Maybe during a weekend so nobody from school is there.

(PCPG) Isn’t the building locked during the weekend?

(Tom|Tom, 4, smittenMIN) Yeah, but Brad told me about a secret window in the philosophy classroom that never closes properly.

This Brad Garlinghouse character seems to be a master of all things [i]sketch[/i] and [i]sus’[/i].

(Tom|Tom, 2, happyMAX) So what do you think? Wanna’ hang out?

[Choice]
*That sounds great!*
*I think I’m busy that day.*

*That sounds great!*
(PCPG) That sounds great!

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMIN) Awesome. I’ll let you know when. I’m sure a good opportunity will show up eventually.
*

*I think I’m busy that day.*
Although Tom is a good buddy to study with, I would not personally want to hang out with him.

(PCPG) I think I’m busy that day.

(Tom, 1, sadMIN)

Tom looks at me weirdly while frowning. He’s acting as if I just made a major social faux paus.

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offleft, slide, center)

[Tom leaves]

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) Hey PCPG, do you mind if we sit and talk for a bit?

We sometimes do this. He likes to check up on my life to make sure I’m doing okay.

(PCPG) That’s fine. Let’s talk.

It’s amazing how much more comfortable I am talking to the professor than I used to be.

After the usual review and discussion about my grades and participation in the class, we eventually move to more personal and heady topics.

A particularly familiar and uncomfortable subject comes up…

(Nate, campus, smoking, neutral|shades)

(PCPG) It’s not that I don’t want to become fit or go to the gym. It’s just that I don’t think it’s possible for me to succeed there...

(PCPG) I’ve tried in the past and it’s always ended with a $20 order of Chili’s-To-Go that I eat in the car by myself at one in the morning…

I look up at Nate’s face, expecting disappointment and judgement.

(Nate, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades)

But he looks surprisingly non-judgemental and unperturbed, which is comforting.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) You know, it’s not easy for me either.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) It’s a struggle anytime I have to go to the gym.

It’s surprising to hear Nate, the supposed shining greek model of discipline and self control, talk like this.

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, happyMIN|shades) I don’t want to pressure you into anything. So we can just leave it be for now.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, happyMED|shades) I think it’s more important to work on building the inner self than the outer self anyways!

Nate always knows how to assuage my concerns.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) Since you told me something personal about you, I’m going to tell you something personal about [i]me[/i].

This should be interesting.

You’ve learned quite a lot about Nate’s personal philosophies and intellectual ideas, but haven’t delved much into his personal life.

(PCPG) What’s up?

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) There’s something I want to do at the end of the semester.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) A goal of sorts, except I have some reservations about it.

It’s interesting to think of Nate as the type of person who aspires to do [i]anything[/i], afterall, it seems like his life is perfectly in order.

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, shockMIN|shades) There’s an event at the end of the semester called the [i]Radical Conference[/i] that I’ve been invited to speak at.

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, happyMIN|shades) This is a great opportunity to showcase my professional and academic research, especially since it will be recorded and live streamed to thousands across the world.

(PCPG) Wow! This seems incredible!

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, smittenMED|shades) Yes! It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

I personally don't have much knowledge about the professional academic world, except that I know it’s good for young professors and academics to get their research out into the world when they can.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) But most importantly, this is a great opportunity to really help some people.

(Nate|Nate, campus, pointing, shockMIN|shades) I’d love to change some hearts and minds out there and help people unlock their full potential!

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, smittenMIN|shades) I guess you could say this is my [i]kokoro wish[/i]!

I don’t get the reference, but it’s obvious this wish of Nate’s is very heartfelt.

(PCPG) This all sounds perfectly in your wheelhouse. What problem could you possibly have?

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, confusedMAX|shades) The problem is that the conference director invited me late in the process, so I don’t have much time to prepare as comprehensively as I would like...

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades) I guess you could consider it a weakness of mine that I can’t do anything without proper notice beforehand and time to prepare...

It’s interesting that Nate is even framing this as a weakness, afterall, I feel I could personally benefit from acquiring just a bit of Nate’s long-term judiciousness.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, angryMIN|shades) The truth is that my propensity for needing to [i]think things through[/i] before acting has made me miss out on some opportunities in the past…

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, neutral|shades) In this vein, I actually aspire to be more like Professor Digibro.

Professor Digi... The dude who teaches me music and Japanese on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) Digibro always dives headfirst into any opportunity. He never hesitates. He never stops to think about the consequences.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades) I can’t help but think that that’s part of the reason for his incredible popularity and clout relative to mine.

I’ve never thought about comparing the professors of the school like this, but it’s true that if someone were to be judged on their own level above everyone else, it would be Digi.

(PCPG) But I think Digi’s cavalier and cowboy-ish attitude can get him in trouble too, ya know?

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, confusedMIN|shades) Sure… that’s the rationalization I give [i]myself[/i] as well.

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, confusedMED|shades) But he’s succeeding in ways I’m not. He seems to have a kind of X-factor.

(Nate|Nate, campus, smoking, shockMIN|shades) I think he’s doing a lot more right than wrong.

Nate’s making a good point.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) So I want to be more like Professor Digibro. I want to be able to live a life of improvisation and extemporaneity like him.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades) I want to learn to stop being afraid of opportunities.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades) I would normally decline this conference invitation for being on such short notice…

(PCPG) Well it sounds like you know what to do next!

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, confusedMIN|shades) Yeah…

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades)

It feels like Nate, of all people, should be able to rise to the occasion, but he still seems to not be very confident about going to this conference.

I guess everyone has their personal journeys to endure and crosses to bear, and it’s impossible to truly relate to each other's strife.

Nate is looking down at the floor in a ponderous and reserved contemplation…

[Location: gym]

[fade from black]

I never thought I’d find myself in a freakin’ [i]GYM[/i] of all places. The plan was for me to meet Nate here.

It’s been a few weeks since Nate confided in me about his conference dilemma, since then, my grades have continued to improve.

Most importantly, something Nate in particular likes to emphasize, my [i]confidence[/i] has greatly risen. I’m finally comfortable trying this whole gym thing out.

Regardless of my newfound confidence, I don’t think I could have even started if Nate hadn’t offered to help me out. 

Nate and I continued to talk after the fateful library discussion a couple weeks ago. He’s still ambivalent and undecided about whether he should attend the upcoming conference. He’s trying his best to get ready, but it’s becoming increasingly obvious that he won’t have enough time to prepare as he wants. Something I think he knew from the very beginning...

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMIN|shades, offleft, slide, right)

I see Nate in the distance running on a treadmill.

As I approach, it’s very obvious that he is listening to a mixtape of various anime OP’s while running. If I squint my ears, I think I can hear [i]Dragon Maid OP[/i] bleeding from his earphones.

(Nate, casual, standing, smittenMED|shades)

He seems pumped and determined.

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMIN|shades)

I catch his gaze and he gives me a gentle wave of acknowledgement and a smile while he slows down the treadmill and removes his earphones. He approaches.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, happyMIN|shades, right, slide, center) Ready to start, bro?

I’m sure my past self would find it dismaying to know that his future self would be getting a personal training session from Nate Bestman, the [i]guy[/i] himself.

(PCPG) Let’s do it!

But Nate’s turned into one of my closest friends…

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades) I’m gonna’ have you start off with some light cardio.

Cardio means running or cycling or some shit. I know that much at least.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades) So there’s a treadmill, and there’s an indoor track over there.

(Nate, casual, pointing, neutral|shades)

He points off into the near distance.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades) Which would you rather use?

[Choice]
*Treadmill*
*Indoor Track*

*Treadmill*
I’ve never used a track like that before, and there seems to be various signs explaining how the different lanes work. It’s a little intimidating.

I at least know I’ve used a treadmill before. Treadmills are much more familiar. That’s more my style.

I start a determined jaunt towards a treadmill and Nate takes this as a tacit answer to his query.

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) Just do a few minutes at a light jogging pace and then meet me over by the free weights.

I give my bro a thumbs up and then slowly raise the speed of the machine up to an ambling saunter.

(Nate, casual, papers, neutral|shades, center, slide, offright)

I don’t know what he means by [i]free weights[/i], but I’m sure I’ll find Nate again with a short circuit ‘round the gym after I’m done here.

There’s only two other people on treadmills with me, and both are in a strong galloping scamper going at much faster paces than me. A quick peek at their displays confirms that I’m easily being lapped by many yards.

They’ve both got those athletic earphones that wrap around the ear and that can withstand their quick and heavy strides. Dang, I should have brought some music.

I’m sure some [i]Bebop OP[/i] would really fuel my [i]light jog[/i] right now.

I complete around twelve minutes worth of running before I decide it’s good enough, then awkwardly stumble off the treadmill trying to bring the machine to a stationary pace. The maneuver wasn’t quite as graceful and easy as Nate made it look earlier.
*

*Indoor Track*
The indoor track area seems a little more secluded and out-of-the-way. That’s more my style.

I start a determined jaunt towards the track and Nate takes this as a tacit answer to his query.

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, shockMIN|shades) Just do a few laps at a light jogging pace and then meet me over by the free weights.

I give my bro a thumbs up and start an ambling saunter down the track.

(Nate, casual, papers, neutral|shades, center, slide, offright)

I don’t know what he means by [i]free weights[/i], but I’m sure I’ll find Nate again with a short circuit ‘round the gym after I’m done here.

There’s only two other people on the track with me, and both are in a strong galloping scamper in the inner lane beside me. They pass me on my left every now and then.

They’ve both got those athletic earphones that wrap around the ear and that can withstand their quick and heavy strides. Dang, I should have brought some music.

I’m sure some [i]2nd GIG OP[/i] would really fuel my [i]light jog[/i] right now.

I finish about five or six laps before I lope off the track to my right.
*

I take in a long draft of water at a nearby fountain while catching my breath. I should probably also bring my own water bottle next time. A bottle and earphones seem like some pretty obvious sundries for the gym in hindsight.

The two runners are still in their same spurting canter. They don’t seem to be stopping soon. Normally I would find this discouraging, but it’s actually comforting to know that I can achieve that for myself if I put in the work. 

A quick semi-circuit ‘round the gym and I find Nate sitting on a bench over by the dumbbells.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, offright, slide, center)

He doesn’t seem to notice me as I approach beside him.

(Nate, casual, standing, confusedMIN|shades)

As he often does, Nate is gazing into the distance seemingly lost in thought, although this feels a little different from normal as his stare is much more resolved and focused.

[b][i]jiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii--[/i][/b]

Following his line of sight, I find that the subject of his glare is a young woman in the distance. She’s fiddling with a large piece of gym machinery.

There’s plenty about Nate that I don’t know, but the seemingly degenerate scene that is unfolding before me seems a little out of character for him.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades) It’s called a Smith machine.

I’m startled as Nate suddenly speaks up.

I swear that he hadn’t noticed me arrive, but obviously he did.

With a bit more tonal context, I take another glance at the scene Nate is focusing on.

The young woman appears to be struggling to set up and use the machine. The [i]Smith[/i] machine as Nate calls it. She’s very obviously new to the gym as she seems out of place and largely uncomfortable. 

(Nate, casual, standing, angryMED|shades)

She eventually turns visibly flustered and her sudden frustration triggers Nate to jump up from the bench. Nate’s mouth tightens and his eyes close slightly to match his now [i]piercing[/i] gaze. Nate’s right hand is closing into a fist in tension.

It’s a bewildering scene that would be confusing to any of the gym passersby, if they weren’t all so focused on their routines. Getting to know Nate much more in the past month, I have a good idea of what’s going on.

(PCPG) Nate, I’m sure you know what to do next.

I implore him. Nate continues staring, unaffected, as if not hearing my urging.

Breaking the stagnant tension, Nate acknowledges my imploration.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, shockMIN|shades) It’s not so simple. I have no idea who she is.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades)

(PCPG) Well you don’t need to know her entire life just to help her out real quick.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, confusedMAX|shades) All my routines and fitness reference documents are at home, and I have no idea what kind of diet she’s on!

(Nate, casual, standing, angryMIN|shades)

(PCPG) Just help her out like you’re helping me today!

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, confusedMIN|shades) Yes, but I know your basic fitness and nutritional history, and I know what your goals are.

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, angryMIN|shades) With you, I have all the necessary information and I am completely prepared. With her, I’ve got nothing.

(Nate, casual, standing, angryMIN|shades)

It’s undeniably insane that Nate is being this neurotic over what should be a simple matter. If he doesn’t want to help, then he doesn’t have to, but Nate very obviously [i]wants[/i] to help.

(PCPG) You don’t have to write up an entire exercise regimen for her, you just have to show her how that one machine works.

It feels odd to be the rational voice with someone like Nate.

(Nate, casual, standing, confusedMIN|shades)

He continues his tacit, intense, stasis.

(PCPG) Nate…

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades) Alright…

Nate takes a deep breath, exhales, relaxes, and starts a gentle shuffle towards the inciting scene of [i]the woman and the Smith machine[/i].

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, center, slide, offleft)

Sounds like a good band name.

I decide it judicious and discreet to abstain from the voyeuristic observance that I have been engaging in for eight minutes now, and I head off to the locker rooms.

[fade to black]

[Nate leaves]

[pause]

[Location: gym]

[fade from black]

When I emerge from the back of the gym, back to where I was before, I see Nate and the woman at the Smith machine.

Nate seems to have succeeded in his endeavor and is now guiding the woman on form as she utilizes the machinery. He’s poised in a very familiar, didactic but gentle, tone and stature as he tenderly oversees the woman’s technique.

Nate calls it a Smith machine, but the woman seems to be doing squats, plain and simple.

The woman finishes her rep and they both burst out in mutual jovial laughter and smiles, giving each other a high five and a hug. I’m reminded at just how charming Nate can be, despite his sometimes stilted and cautious nature. Perhaps he has [i]more[/i] complex affectations that I still don’t know about.

Nate makes his way back to the dumbbells.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, offleft, slide, center)

From knowing him for a while now, I’ve noticed that Nate prefers to maintain a rather stern and austere disposition by default.

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMED|shades)

So when this facade breaks and he can’t help but present a wide and sincere grin, as he’s doing now, I know that he’s genuinely happy.

He stops in front of me and stares, contentedly, right at me. He says nothing.

He’s a lot more comfortable with these dramatic pauses than I am.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, happyMED|shades) You were right!

(Nate|Nate, casual, smoking, happyMIN|shades) It wasn’t bad at all.

It goes without saying that for Nate, this was all more than just simply giving a quick tip on technique. Nate overcame his worries about lack of preparation, and managed to help a struggling newbie get closer to their true potential.

Nate [i]accomplished[/i] something.

(PCPG) I knew you could do it! [i]You[/i], of all people, should of course be able to do it!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, happyMIN|shades) Thanks, man.

(Nate, casual, pointing, happyMED|shades)

Nate glides over and puts his arm around my shoulders, still smiling.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, happyMAX|shades) Let’s do some bicep curls!

I’m in an emotionally painful daze.

My heart’s racing. My hands feel tight and numb. My chest is hot with pain, and my senses are muddled and off balance.

(PCPG) What happened?

How much time has it been? I start staggering and stumbling through the alleyway.

A faintly familiar and disconcerting voice lurches forward from the back of my mind…

[i][b]It’s not my fault…[/i][/b]

I can’t tell if I feel totally empty or completely stuffed with emotion.

[Location: 7eleven.night]

I end up in a place I haven’t gone to in a long time. For some reason, I haven’t felt the need to in many weeks. I don’t even know why my body took me here.

[i]old habits…[/i]

Wasn’t I [i]just[/i] at the gym a couple hours ago with Nate? I remember he had just finished helping a young woman figure out an exercise machine…

The rest I don’t remember right now….

Without even directing it consciously, my body seems to shuffle slowly over to the doors of the 7-Eleven. Unfortunately, I think I know what this is about. It’s not just today. I don't think I’ve ever enjoyed this.

[fade to black]

[Location: 7eleven.interior]

[fade from black]

I slowly make my way over to the energy drink section. There’s flashbacks in my mind quickly going through the rising dramatic scenes that led me to this moment.

Nate had started me on the bicep curls, which weren’t so bad by themselves, but things had changed by the third new exercise. My body was sore and tired all over. Nate showed no sign of ceasing his forward-prodding.

I suddenly couldn’t think of a single good reason as to why I was at the gym at all.

Why would I ever want to endure something like that?

Why is it so needlessly hard?

What’s the point?

Why?!

…

(PCPG) [i][b]This is Nate’s fault.[/i][/b]

[i]So why do I feel so guilty?[/i]

Although I haven’t done this in weeks, I know exactly what aisle to go to, which refrigerator door to open, and which shelf to scan. I’ve always pretended and lied to myself about the Soy Bang Energy.

The truth is that I’ve always gotten it on purpose; There was never any kind of choice to it.

It’s funny how it works. These kinds of quick indulgences are only ever enjoyable in anticipation. Every sip and bite past the first is propelled purely out of habit and aimless obligation.

I look at my watch. I’m sure Nate is still at the gym finishing up his [i]own[/i] workout. A determined echo within me makes sure I realize that I can still meet up with him if I head back now, but I know there’s no type of rationalization I could give myself that would stop me at this point.

I’ve made my bed.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades)

I run over while rubbing my eyes. They were starting to well up. The encounter is rather awkward as I don’t know quite how to proceed.

(Nate, casual, pointing, happyMED|shades)

Nate, always seeming to know exactly what to do, simply extends his arms with a smile, inviting me in.

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMIN|shades)

I accept and we both end up hugging right in the middle of the gym. I’m sure this all seemed much more dramatic to me than to all of the gym goers around us.

Nate’s embrace calms all my worries and placates the constricting storm of emotions that had been building up inside me. We release the hug.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades)

(PCPG) I’m sorry, Nate. None of this is your fault!

(PCPG) All you’ve done is boost me up and give me the opportunity to better myself and work towards my goals.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, happyMIN|shades) No worries, PCPG. I understand!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|shades) It’s my fault anyways for pushing you too hard and not being able to read the cues you were giving off.

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMED|shades)

Staring into his eyes and beaming countenance assuages the rest of my concerns. I think Nate’s always going to have no problem taking in the emotional brunt of all his relationships. It’s not fair, but it’s the kind of person he is. 

He is a shining Greek pillar that lifts everyone up above him, supporting them, and standing resolute and strong as an ideal model.

I’m still determined, though. I know what I need to do.

(PCPG) Nate. We’re not done here.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, shockMIN|shades) Oh yeah? What’s up?

(PCPG) We’re gonna’ finish up that set, but I need [i]you[/i] to help me.

(Nate, casual, smoking, smittenMED|shades)

At hearing that, Nate immediately lights up. This is one of the rare times where it’s [i]me[/i] who catches [i]Nate[/i] off guard.

(Nate, casual, pointing, happyMAX|shades)

Nate gets pumped and flexes his bicep.

(Nate|Nate, casual, maniacal) [i][b]Fuck yeah! Let’s do it!![/i][/b]

I managed to finish up the set with Nate, say our goodbyes to each other, and then go our separate ways.

The session ended up being a lot of work, but it feels incredible to have accomplished it. I haven’t felt this kind of satisfaction in a while.

My body feels relatively fine and normal considering the exercise I got, but Nate made sure to remind me that I’ll likely feel the most physical impact tomorrow. He said I should take it easy.

My phone lights up. It rouses me from my wandering thoughts and reflections.

A text from Nate.

[i]Hey, PCPG. Great job today! Just wanted to let you know that I think I’m going to go ahead and do the conference! (-:[/i]

It’s been about a month since I first went to the gym with Nate. It’s funny to think that I ever doubted him… or myself…

Saying I go to the gym on a regular basis would be an understatement. That [i]Guy[/i] showed me that it’s always worth it to have goals, despite it not always being easy.

I’m glad I’m no longer wasting time lounging around at home or at the 7-Eleven. I now spend my time working out or duteously studying.

I’ve become a regular gym rat and don’t even require Nate’s help anymore. Now we just work out [i]together[/i] and spot for each other.

I’ve also made more time for friends. Tom’s shown me how much fun playing [i]PS2[/i] games are, while Nate’s gotten me into the satisfyingly difficult [i]Souls[/i] games. Hanging out with Nate has especially been rewarding. I don’t think I’ve ever had as special a relationship as this.

Nate’s going to be doing a lecture at the upcoming conference, which is very important due to the event’s [i]clout[/i] and [i]cachet[/i]. At first he was worried about the fact that he wouldn’t be able to prepare properly in time.

Nate’s normal approach to life can be described as [i]cautious[/i] and [i]considered[/i], but it seems he’s grown this semester and has come to terms with the reality of the event. He’s not going to let an opportunity pass by due to fear. He’s going to drive forward without letting his concerns slow him down.

Nate’s new approach to life can be described as [i]cavalier[/i] and [i]carefree[/i].

[Location: pcpgbathroom]

The semester is pretty much over.

I’m still not arriving to class late, which means I get to hear the awesome [i]Urban Dictionary[/i] Word of the Day from Nate.

I’ve gained about two pounds of muscle in the last month. I borrowed some equipment from Nate to measure that. He says he’s jealous of my natural genetics. Ha!

This is the best I’ve ever physically felt.

Nate says that it’s reflecting in my confidence as well. My GPA is also the highest it’s ever been. At this point, I’m even on track to receive an extra scholarship for next semester.

A text from Nate.

[i]Hey, PCPG. Sorry for all the weirdness last night. Just thought I should let you know that I decided for sure that I’m not going to the conference…[/i]

There’s a few more sentences to the text, but you’re already bored. You block the number and go back to sleep.

It’s been about a month since your debacle with Professor Bestman. It’s funny to think that you were ever close to him.

Saying you’ve grown apart would be an understatement.

The [i]Guy’s[/i] a self-important asshole with a messiah complex. You’re glad you no longer have to waste your time with his pointless hoop jumping.

He was obviously using you to boost his own ego and to justify his self-aggrandizing proselytizing. 

He speaks of lofty aspirations, but is only looking to use others as stepping stones to raise his own ego and conceit.

[Location: pcpgbathroom]

The semester is pretty much over.

You’re still not arriving to class late, because you’re not even going to class…

You’ve gained fifteen pounds in the last month. This is the fattest you’ve ever been…

Your grades are also really bad. At this point, there’s no way that you’ll be able to maintain your funding for next semester.

...things are...

[i]...not looking good....[/i]

It’s 11:00pm at night. Just finished up my session at the gym and all [i]routes[/i] forward look [i]good[/i].

No Nate today. Tomorrow is his big day at the conference so of course he probably spent the evening doing some last-minute [i]preparation[/i].

In fact, he should be asleep by now.

I should be asleep [i]myself[/i] by now.

I have no obligations tomorrow so I thought I would just hit the gym real quick before going home.

[Location: waytoschool.night]

(Tom, 1, neutral, offright, slide, right)$

(Ben, casual, base, neutral, offleft, slide, left)

Woah. It’s Tom and Ben! I didn’t expect to see these two guys of all people this late in the night.

They both approach me.

(Tom|Tom, 2, happyMIN) Hey, PCPG!

(Tom|Tom, 1, shockedMAX) You know Professor Saint, right?

Obviously I know such a crazy character as Ben!

(PCPG) Yes!

We greet each other and shake hands.

(Tom, 1, neutral)$

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, happyMIN) So how’s philosophy with Nate?

Surprisingly, this made me balk. It goes without saying that my time with Nate has burgeoned into something really special.

I’m not a social miscreant though so I know now’s not the time for melodrama. The minimalist and understated approach should work just fine.

(PCPG) It’s… uhhhhh… good!

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, happyMAX) Great!

(Ben, casual, point, happyMIN)

Ben is smiling. That smile looks incredibly familiar…

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMAX) You know I haven’t seen you at the weekly discussion sections in a while. Where have you been?

It would probably be inappropriate and awkward to tell Tom that I’ve actually just been having one on one sessions with Nate at his place of living.

(PCPG) I’ve been…. uhhhhh….

(PCPG) busy!

(Tom, 1, happyMIN)$

Tom seems satisfied and content with this answer. Everyone is being perfectly pleasant.

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, happyMIN) Well we were actually just parting ways for the night. It was good to see you again, PCPG!

(Tom|Tom, 2, happyMIN) See ya’ around!

(Ben, casual, base, neutral, left, slide, offleft)$

(Tom, 1, neutral, right, slide, offright)

[Ben leaves]

[Tom leaves]

They both go in opposite directions. Normally this would be unfortunate, because I would usually love to continue catching up with them, but I’m actually pretty tired and should be heading to bed anyways.

Tomorrow’s another day full of possibility and opportunity!

[StopMusic]

[Song: PCPDating_FallenGlass]

Suddenly, I get a text. It’s from Nate. Shouldn’t he be asleep?

[i]Hey...[/i]

Hey! He’s stealing my minimalist approach!

Before I can send a response, he sends another text.

[i]Can you come over? Door’s unlocked.[/i]

This is bizarre behavior for Nate. He doesn’t usually text me all nonspecific like this. He usually makes it clear what he has in mind.

Either way, I should head over...

[Location: genericapartment]

The tone of the text makes me a little uneasy. But surely he would have mentioned it if it was something dramatic, right?

I walk up to his door…

[SFX: PCP-SFX_DoorOpen]

[Location: nateroom]

My source was correct; access was easy.

I thought Nate would be in his bedroom, but he isn’t.

Whatever he was doing, he was obviously using the living room because it’s an insane torrential mess of papers and empty aluminum cans.

Note cards, paper sheets, stationary, poster paper, reference textbooks, journal articles... Empty containers of energy drinks, canned coffee, cup noodles, name-brand soda, [i]store[/i]-brand soda… [i]ALL[/i] over Nate’s furniture.

It looked [b]terrible[/b].

It looked like my bedroom three months ago, excluding the scholarly literature of course.

Thankfully his bedroom is as clean as [i]normal[/i]. There’s a ziploc bag of white powder on his desk that is disconcerting, though.

A shuffle from behind startles me. I turn around.

[Song: PCPDating_Forsaken]

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|beard, offleft, slide, center)

Nate emerges from the shadows of the hallway.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard) PCPG...

(PCPG) Oh my god, Nate! The living room is a pit!!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, confusedMAX|beard) PCPG... I can’t do it…

(PCPG) What the hell are you talking about? What happened here?!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard) The conference… I can’t do it…

(Nate, casual, standing, confusedMIN|beard)

Upon closer inspection of Nate, I notice he’s in a similar state as his living room. His hair is a greasy mess, he stopped shaving, and he’s wearing the same clothes from when I saw him two days ago. This [i]guy[/i] looks like he hasn’t been out of the house since you last saw him.

His eyes are watery red. He looks [i]tired[/i].

(PCPG) Your lecture at the conference tomorrow? 

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, sadMED|beard) I’m sorry… I can’t do it. I can’t do the conference. I’m not [i]ready[/i].

He’s not [i]ready[/i]? I thought that arc was done?!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard) My speech isn’t ready. I’ve got so many sources to still go through. My references haven’t been updated in a while…

(PCPG) I thought you said you were fine improvising for the lecture?

(Nate, casual, standing, angryMIN|beard)

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, angryMED|beard) I [i]know[/i] what I said, PCPG. I [b]KNOW[/b] what I said.

(Nate, casual, standing, angryMIN|beard)

I’ve never seen him get like this. He’s my friend, but it’s scary to be the subject of this sudden animosity. 

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, angryMED|beard) You don’t understand what kind of pressure this is. It [i]needs[/i] to be perfect!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard) If I just had a little bit more time…

I’m hesitant to speak up...

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, confusedMIN|beard) With just a couple more weeks, I could have been 100% prepared.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, confusedMAX|beard) This isn’t something that should be done off the cuff! There’s too much room for mistakes that way.

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, angryMED|beard) It’s [i]not my fault[/i] this damn conference director took so long to contact me. It’s the most unprofessional fucking thing I’ve ever seen!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, angryMIN|beard) I swear I’m going to report this guy to the union for this.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, angryMAX|beard) I’ll make sure he’s blacklisted from every major university on the east coast!

(Nate, casual, standing, angryMIN|beard)

Nate’s gradually approaching me while he continues his diatribe. I’m uneasily looking behind me to make sure I don’t trip as I inch backwards to make space.

(Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard)

Nate’s starting to genuinely break down. His words are coming out choked.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMAX|beard) I can’t… do it… I [i]can’t[/i] do it….. [b]I can’t do it[/b]!

(Nate, casual, standing, sadMED|beard)

Nate lurches forward suddenly and surrounds my frame with his arms in a heavy hold.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard) PCPG... I’m not good enough…

With the change of tone in his voice, Nate releases some of his weight onto me and loosens his clasp. I try my best to support his body and keep him standing.

Seeing Nate like this is absolutely disheartening.

Unfortunately, I don’t have much experience with these kinds of dismal events. I guess the best I can do is try to tell Nate the truth… and how I really feel.

(PCPG) Nate… It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.

(PCPG) I’m here for you.. I want to help.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, shockMIN|beard)$

(PCPG) You’ve done so much for [i]me[/i] over the last few months. You’ve been the most incredible role model!

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|beard)

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, neutral|beard) I’m not sure taking you to the gym a few times counts as doing much.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|beard)$

(PCPG) It definitely hasn’t been just that. You [i]know[/i] it hasn’t been just that.

(PCPG) Especially compared to where I used to be…

(PCPG) My whole life has changed!

I’m absolutely certain about how I feel, but I guess I’ve never taken the time to tell Nate any of this.

(Nate, casual, smoking, confusedMIN|beard)$

(PCPG) I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, and all my future prospects are perfectly in order due to your guidance.

(PCPG) My grades are up and I’m even looking at applying to various graduate programs.

(PCPG) Getting healthy and fit gave me back my productivity and fulfillment in life!

(Nate, casual, smoking, shockMED|beard)$

(PCPG) That’s all due to [i]you[/i], Nate.

[StopMusic]

[Song: PCPDating_Beloved]

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|beard)

Nate gathers enough strength to stand up on his own. He stares off into the distance at a downward angle, seeming to be in deep contemplation of [i]something[/i].

(Nate, casual, smoking, neutral|beard)

Nate adjusts his posture, as if to speak, but takes a brief hold before continuing. The energy in the room has changed.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, sadMIN|beard) I’m sorry, PCPG...

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, shockMIN|beard) What have I been doing? It’s like I’ve gone against everything I believe in!

(Nate, casual, papers, neutral|beard)$

(PCPG) This has nothing to do with your values, Nate. It’s impossible to drive forward endlessly.

(PCPG) Eventually, everyone falls down. And it’s you who taught me that getting back up is simply another step forward.

(PCPG) And I’ll always be there to support you!

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMIN|beard|blush)

Nate starts smiling demurely.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, happyMED|beard, blush) Thanks, PCPG.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, smittenMED|beard) You’re absolutely right! Life is about continuously getting back up.

Nate’s getting pumped and passionate.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|beard, center, slide, offleft)

(Nate, casual, standing, smittenMIN|shades, offleft, slide, center)

Woah. How did he shave so quickly.

(Nate, casual, smoking, smittenMED|shades)

He’s back to the same ol’ Nate!

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, happyMED|shades) Life is about driving forward without fear. Life is about taking the reins. Life is about flying head-first into the flames!

In all the excitement, Nate goes through a series of bodybuilding poses as a physical manifestation of his extreme passion!

First the [i]Side Chest[/i] and then the [i]Front Double Bicep[/i].

I’ve learned a lot about bodybuilding from my time with Nate.

(Nate|Nate, casual, maniacal) [b]Yeah baby![/b]

He ends with the [i]Most Muscular[/i], the same pose as Ronnie Coleman in the picture on the wall behind him.

(Nate, casual, pointing, happyMED|shades)

They’re both giving the same wide genuine smile and incredible aura. This is what it means to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!

This is what it means to sacrifice.

(Nate, casual, standing, smittenMIN|shades)

Nate relaxes, walks over to me, and puts his hand on my shoulder, firmly.

(Nate|Nate, casual, pointing, happyMIN|shades) Thank you so much, PCPG. You’ve done a lot for me today. I have something I want to give you.

(Nate, casual, papers, neutral|shades)

Nate pulls out what seems like a white ticket from his back pocket and hands it to me.

(Nate, casual, smoking, smittenMIN|shades)$

It reads: ‘[i]Entry for One Into [b]Radical Conference[/b] Event.[/i]’ It’s dated for tomorrow…

(Nate|Nate, casual, smoking, happyMIN|shades) That’s right. I’m allowed a [i]+1[/i] for the conference and I want you to be there.

(PCPG) Oh my gosh, Nate. This is amazing. I can’t express how much this means to me.

(PCPG) I’ll definitely be there. And I’ll definitely be giving you my support!

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, happyMED|shades) Nothing would make me happier.

Nate’s giving me that familiar comforting smile.

(Nate, casual, smoking, shockMIN|shades)

(PCPG) You know, you actually have some pretty decent taste in energy drinks! Some of these flavors are even hard to find…

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, happyMIN|shades) Haha yeah! But don’t be looking at me, because I actually didn’t buy any of these. I got them from Professor Saint.

That makes more sense. I often see Ben walking around campus with an [i]XDurance[/i] in his hand.

(Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, center, slide right)

Nate walks over to his desk and picks up the ziploc bag of white powder.

(Nate|Nate, casual, papers, neutral|shades) He also gave me this caffeine powder.

[b]caffeine powder…[/b]

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades, right, slide, center) Speaking of Professor Saint, he actually texted me that he ran into you earlier this night.

(PCPG) Yeah! I just ran into Tom and Ben before coming here. He [i]texted[/i] you about me?

Why would Ben do that?

(Nate|Nate, casual, smoking, confusedMIN|shades) Yeah. Saint has a pretty good intuitive sense when it comes to what people are going through, and he knows how close we’ve gotten recently.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, shockMIN|shades) For example, I’m sure he wouldn’t hesitate to let me know if he thought you needed help with anything, [b]dramatic[/b] or otherwise.

(Nate|Nate, casual, standing, neutral|shades)$

Maybe [b]this time[/b] Ben was looking after Nate.

(PCPG) So what are you going to do about your speech then?

(Nate|Nate, casual, smoking, confusedMAX|shades) You know what?..

(Nate, casual, papers, confusedMED|shades)

Nate carefully selects a few note cards that were on his bed and holds them up.

(Nate|Nate, casual, smoking, smittenMED|shades) I think all I really need are these few cards and a good night’s sleep.

(Nate, casual, standing, happyMED|shades)$

(PCPG) I think you’re right, Nate.

Now it’s me who’s smiling.

With that we say our goodbyes and I show myself out.

Tom seems satisfied and content with this answer.

He ended up taking you to his apartment. His place of living seems of similar taste to Professor Bestman’s…

You sit there calmly while he fills the room with vapor.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, shockMIN) Want a vape?

You shake your head in refusal. 

You don’t vape. Not anymore.

Not that you don’t have your vices.

He opens up a mini fridge beside him to reveal a grand assortment of different brands, colors, and flavors of energy drinks. As a bit of an energy drink connoisseur yourself, you can’t help but be astonished.

After grabbing a [i]Rip It[/i] from the fridge, he notices your surprised gaze.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, happyMAX) Pretty cool, eh? I can see you’re a fan of energy drinks!

(PCPG) That’s incredible. That must last you for months!

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, happyMIN) Yeah, I like to buy in bulk to save money. 

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, smittenMIN) What brand and flavor do you want? I probably have it in here somewhere.

(PCPG) Soy Bang--

You catch yourself before continuing. You’re not quite ready to commit social [i]suicide[/i].

(PCPG) The standard [i]Monster[/i] is fine…

(Ben, casual, point, shockMIN)

He tosses over a white can and you catch it.

You asked for the standard green [i]Monster[/i], but this is very obviously the [i]Zero Ultra[/i]. You crack it open and take a sip.

It has less of a burn than regular [i]Monster[/i], like it’s less carbonated. It tastes good, though.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, smittenMIN) If you’re ever looking to buy energy drinks, I would recommend going into any dollar store and purchasing [i]Rip It’s[/i].

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) They’re definitely not the best tasting, but they have the most amount of value; 160mg’s of caffeine for one dollar.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, happyMAX) It’s an insane deal!

You wonder why anyone would be so neurotic as to actually care about the amount of caffeine in their drinks. As if reading your mind, Ben responds. 

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) The reason why caffeine content is important is because of something called [i]caffeine tolerance[/i].

This mind reading feels dismayingly familiar.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, neutral) If you consume caffeine on a regular basis, your body will eventually acclimate and you will need [i]more[/i] to get the same effect.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) Science doesn’t have any definite research, but I’ve calculated that you can’t drink more than 300mg’s of caffeine a week without gaining a caffeine tolerance.

(PCPG) How much coffee is 300mg’s of caffeine?

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, sadMIN) About three cups.

(PCPG) What?! That’s nothing! Three cups of coffee max a week?!

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, angryMIN) Yup! It’s why it’s so common for people to have a psychological dependence on caffeine or coffee.

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, angryMAX) They’ve raised their tolerance to such high levels that they need a lot just to feel [i]normal[/i].

(PCPG) Wow. That’s unfortunate.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, happyMIN) Yup. But the good thing is that anyone can get their body back to normal tolerance by just going cold turkey on caffeine for a couple weeks.

Not drinking coffee for that long seems like it would be a Sisyphean task for some of the addicts that you personally know.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, angryMIN) Caffeine [i]is[/i] a good thing. It genuinely helps with focus and energy.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) But like anything in life, moderation is key.

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, happyMAX) As Plato and Aristotle told us: moderation is a moral virtue!

You suddenly remember that he’s also a philosophy teacher at school.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) But you don’t have to worry about any of this if you don’t want to. Feel free to just keep enjoying energy drinks however you want.

That’s what you were planning on doing anyways.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) Even I’m not perfectly efficient at all times.

You both take a sip from your respective caffeinated beverages.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, shockMIN) It can sometimes be hard to locate the zero-calorie [i]Rip It’s[/i], so the Aldi [i]Summit Red Thunder[/i] can be a good alternative as second-cheapest.

Unprompted, Ben continues.

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, shockMAX) Neither of these taste good, though.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, happyMIN) If you’re looking for pure taste, I’d go for the [i]Rockstar XDurance[/i] series.

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, happyMAX) My personal favorites are the [i]XDurance Cotton Candy[/i] or [i]Marshmallow[/i] flavors!

(Ben, casual, base, sadMIN)

Ben seems to finally notice your increasing restlessness and fatigue as response to his caffeine monologue.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, confusedMIN) So... how’s school going for you?

Ben tries to rescue the conversation with banalities.

(Ben, casual, base, neutral)

(PCPG) Uhhhh… I guess it’s not going the best…

This response puts Ben in a focused and pondering state.

(Ben, casual, point, shockMIN, center, slide, right)

He gets up and goes to a nearby cabinet. After reaching around for a bit, he pulls out a ziploc bag of what seems to be a white powder.

[i]what the fuck?![/i]

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, shockMAX, right, slide, center) Hold on, man! It’s not what you think!

(Ben|Ben, casual, exasp, shockMIN) It’s just caffeine powder!

[i]what?[/i]

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, happyMIN) Not that this is any less illegal in this state.

You’re calmer, but still a little wary.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) Energy drinks are actually a rather inefficient source of caffeine…

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, smittenMIN) This is what I use when I [i]really[/i] have to focus.

(Ben, casual, base, neutral)

He tosses you the bag and it lands in your lap.

(Ben|Ben, casual, base, neutral) Go ahead and take it with you. Maybe it can help you out with your school stuff.

(PCPG) Thanks.

[i]caffeine powder…[/i]

(Ben|Ben, casual, point, angryMIN) Anyways, we should probably call it for the night. I actually have a [i]conference[/i] of sorts I gotta attend tomorrow.

Tom walks over and opens up the trunk of his car to reveal a grand assortment of different colors and flavours of what seems to be nutritional bars. He’s also got large white packages of unknown contents in his car.

All you can read from the packaging is the word: [i]Huel[/i].

(Tom, 4, confusedMAX)

You look on in amazement as he grabs a couple bars and closes the trunk.

(Tom, 1, shockedMAX)

He notices your astonishment as he heads back to the sidewalk.

(Tom|Tom, 2, happyMAX, right, slide, center) Pretty cool, eh? I’ve got just about every flavor of [i]Huel[/i] bar in here. They only recently released these to the US.

(PCPG) That’s so much food! That must last you for months.

You say [i]food[/i] for lack of a better word, as you don’t normally consider nutritional bars to be any kind of decent meal.

(Tom|Tom, 3, neutral) Yeah, I like to buy in bulk to save money. I’ve put a lot of thought into it.

(Tom, 1, angryMIN)

He tosses you a bar. You can see it says [i]Salted Caramel[/i] on the label. It’s [i]Huel[/i] brand.

(PCPG) So what are the larger packages that I saw in the trunk?

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMIN) That’s the standard nutritionally-complete [i]Huel[/i] meal-replacement powder!

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMAX) That’s basically entirely what I eat for weeks on end.

(PCPG) Uhhhh isn’t that stuff bad for you?

(Tom|Tom, 2, angryMAX) Not at all! This isn’t like those stupid meal-replacement shakes such as [i]Slimfast[/i] and stuff.

(Tom|Tom, 2, happyMIN) It was made to be 100% nutritionally complete, so anyone can subsist on that powder by eating it for all their meals!

You’re not convinced. This seems like some real weirdo shit.

(PCPG) Why do you even have it all in your car?

(PCPG) Why not just keep it in your house?

(Tom, 3, confusedMAX)

This question seems to give Tom some pause.

(Tom|Tom, 2, sadMIN) Come on, dude. Don’t you remember I’m homeless?

(Tom, 4, sadMIN)$

Shit. You almost forgot.

(PCPG) Why the fuck are you even living in your car?!

It’s understood that all students are generally poor, but…

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMIN) Look. It’s nothing dramatic.

(Tom|Tom, 1, neutral) I have a very low standard of living, so I just take the opportunity to save some money by sleeping in my car instead of renting an apartment.

You have so many questions and concerns, but his calm yet confident tone of voice is slowly putting you at ease.

(PCPG) Isn’t your car uncomfortable to sleep in?

(Tom|Tom, 4, shockedMAX, center, slide, right) It’s honestly not that bad. Here, I'll show you.

(Tom, 1, angryMIN)

He directs you closer to his car and turns on the light inside. You see that he’s taken out the back seat of his car and replaced it with a series of carefully-placed blankets and pillows overtop a foam cot.

(Tom|Tom, 3, neutral) It’s actually pretty nice to sleep under the stars or underneath the rain at night.

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMAX) It’s like I’m camping outdoors every night!

(PCPG) Doesn’t it get hot or uhhhhh… [i]cold[/i]?

(Tom|Tom, 3, confusedMIN) It’s true that it can get pretty hot, but I just use a decent USB fan connected to a portable charging block that I recharge every day.

(Tom|Tom, 2, sadMAX) The cold is probably the worst part about all this…

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMIN) But I just bundle up, wear multiple layers, and hope for the best.

(Tom|Tom, 2, neutral) If everything goes to shit during a cold winter night, I can just turn on the car heater for a bit anyways.

(PCPG) What about privacy? It must be hard to sleep knowing anyone could be looking in on you during the night!

(Tom|Tom, 4, neutral) That’s what these windows are for.

(Tom, 2, shockedMIN)

He gestures with his hand.

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMAX) I’ve had them tinted as dark as legally allowed in this state. No one can see through [i]this[/i]!

You believe him as the inside of his car goes instantly pitch black when he turns off the light inside.

It now makes sense as to why he’s got so much [i]Huel[/i] food material in the trunk of his car. The only thing this dude can eat besides fast food is [i]Huel[/i] since he doesn’t have access to kitchen appliances or a fridge…

(PCPG) How do you take showers?

(Tom|Tom, 3, neutral, right, slide, center) I just stop by the gym on the way to school every day.

Jesus christ.

You’d rather [i]kill yourself[/i] than live this way.

(Tom, 2, confusedMAX)

Tom seems to notice your increasing restlessness and fatigue as response to the slowly-increasing culture shock to all this new information. He changes the subject.

(Tom|Tom, 3, happyMIN) So... how’s school going for you?

Tom tries to rescue the conversation with banalities.

(PCPG) Uhhhh… I guess it’s not going the best…

(Tom, 4, confusedMAX)

This response puts Tom in an inquisitive and absorbed state.

(Tom, 1, angryMIN, center, slide, right)

He gets up and opens the trunk of his car again.

(Tom, 3, angryMIN)

After reaching around for a bit, he pulls out a ziploc bag of what seems to be white pills. 

Woah. You didn’t think Tom was the kind of person to roll this way. But today’s shown that you obviously don’t know anything about Tom…

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMAX, right, slide, center) Calm down, dude.

(Tom|Tom, 1, shockedMAX) These are just caffeine pills!

[i]what? [/i]

(Tom|Tom, 2, confusedMIN) Not that this is any less illegal than what you might have thought they were…

You’re calmer, but still a little wary.

(PCPG) Aren’t caffeine pills totally legal anyways?

(Tom|Tom, 2, confusedMIN) At the concentration levels you normally see sold in stores… yes.

(Tom|Tom, 3, shockedMAX) But this stuff is about 2.5x more concentrated than normal.

(Tom|Tom, 3, neutral) Coffee is actually a rather inefficient source of caffeine…

(Tom|Tom, 1, neutral) This is what I use when I [i]really[/i] have to focus.

(Tom|Tom, 2, neutral) My friend, Brad Garlinghouse, gave ‘em to me! He’s actually the one who taught me most of these homeless-living tips and tricks too.

This [i]Brad[/i] friend of Tom’s seems to be a rather debauched, debased, and depraved degenerate.

(Tom, 1, angryMIN, center, slide, left)

Tom tosses you the bag of pills and you catch it in your hands.

(Tom|Tom, 1, neutral, left, slide, center) Go ahead and take it with you. Maybe it can help you out with your school stuff.

(Tom|Tom, 1, neutral) That’s a bag of thirty pills so it should last you for a while.

(PCPG) Thanks.

[i]caffeine pills…[/i]

(Tom|Tom, 2, angryMIN) Anyways, we should probably call it for the night. I actually have a conference of sorts I gotta attend tomorrow.

(PCPG) Sounds good…

(Tom, 1, neutral)

[StopMusic]

We say our goodbyes and you turn around to leave.

(Tom, 4, happyMIN)

Tom calls to you one last time.

(Tom|Tom, 2, neutral) Hey, PCPG!

(Tom|Tom, 2, shockedMAX) If you’re going to use the pills, don’t take more than one a day. It’s [i]really[/i] concentrated.

(Tom|Tom, 4, shockedMAX) It’s easy to overdose on that stuff, and it’s potentially [i]lethal[/i].

[i]lethal…[/i]

It’s the day of the conference.

I’ve gone to the address on the ticket and now I’m at the front entrance. I thought this would be at a proper conference hall, hotel, or convention center, but this just seems like a reasonably-sized house.

I knock on the front door.

[SFX: PCP-SFX_DoorKnock]

(Digi, campus, 1, confusedMIN, offright, slide, center)

It’s Digi, the music and Japanese professor! Big man on campus!

(Digi|Digi, campus, 2, confusedMED) Who the hell are you?!

I guess he doesn’t recognize me from his class.

(PCPG) Uhhhh… hey!

(PCPG) Sorry to bother you….

(Digi, campus, 2, angryMIN)

Digi is getting visibly impatient, but it’s hard for me to find the words.

I didn’t expect to be reproached at the gate...

(PCPG) I’m here for the… uhhhh [i]Radical Conference[/i]?

(Digi, campus, 1, confusedMIN)

Digi goes from visibly impatient to visibly perturbed.

(Digi|Digi, campus, 3, angryMED) What are you a fucking narc’?!

[i]what?[/i]

(Digi|Digi, campus, 2, angryMIN) What the fuck you mean, radical conference?!

(Digi|Digi, campus, 3, happyMAX) This is [b]RadCon[/b]!

[i]huhh?[/i]

(Digi, campus, 1, confusedMIN)$

(PCPG) Oh… well I have this ticket…

I meekly hold up my ostensible pass for entry.

(Digi, campus, 4, shockMIN)$

Digi snatches it from my hand.

(Digi, campus, 2, confusedMIN)$

After a minute of inspection, which included a lift to the light to search for watermarks, he doesn’t seem any less perplexed.

(Digi|Digi, campus, 2, shockMAX) Jesus christ. You are a narc’! I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life!

(Digi|Digi, campus, 2, angryMED) Get the hell out of here.

(Digi, campus, 1, angryMIN)$

Digi rips up the ticket.

[i]heart dropping…[/i]

(Digi, campus, 2, shockMIN)$

(PCPG) No wait! I [i]know[/i] this is where the conference is! I [i]need[/i] to be here to support my friend!

(Digi|Digi, campus, 5, shockMED) Give it up, dude. Someone trolled you.

(Digi, campus, 2, shockMIN)$

(PCPG) I’m in your class, Professor Digibro! I take Japanese and Music with you!

(Digi|Digi, campus, 1, confusedMIN) Hmmmmm…

Thankfully, that declarative statement seemed to allay his irritability and buy me some time. 

(Digi, campus, 2, angryMED)$

Digi suddenly darts forward and aggressively pushes his index finger into my chest. He looms over me threateningly, without blinking.

(Digi|Digi, campus, 3, angryMAX) [i][b]Who do you know here!?[/i][/b]

[i]oh god...[/i]

I yell out, much louder than I was planning to.

(PCPG) [i]PROFESSOR BESTMAN!![/i]

(Digi, campus, 1, shockMED)$

[i]That[/i] declarative statement leaves Digi stunned, stumped, startled, and stupefied.

(Digi, campus, 3, happyMED)$

Digi abruptly breaks into uproarious laughter.

(Digi|Digi, campus, 2, happyMAX) Hahahahaha! You should have just [i]said[/i] that from the beginning!

(Digi, campus, 2, happyMIN)$

I'm a little stumped and startled myself at this point, but I’m glad Digi is now in good spirits, lamentably belated as it might be. 

(Digi|Digi, campus, 4, happyMIN) Nate’s one of my closest friends. I’ve known him for a while.

(Digi|Digi, campus, 3, smittenMAX) We often get together to produce a lot of [i][b]KHANNNNTTEENENEHTHTTHTHTTTTTT!!!!11111[/b][/i]

(Digi, campus, 2, smittenMED)

I don’t know what Digi just said, but I’m happy to be on what seems like the right track.

(Digi|Digi, campus, 4, happyMIN) Come on in!

He gestures me inside.

(Digi, campus, 1, neutral, center, slide, offright)

[Digi leaves]

[StopMusic]

[SFX: PCP-SFX_DoorOpen]

[Location: radprom1]

[Song: PCPDating_HappyOrSomething]

Upon entering, Digi disappears into one of the various hallways. I take the opportunity to go on an explorative excursion to familiarize myself with the house and its occupants.

The basic layout appears to be two floors and a basement comprised of various caverns and grottos in the form of hallways, bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, closets, nooks, crawl spaces, and apparently designless or purposeless room-sized cubes of drywall and laminate wood flooring.

A cascade of staircases, stairwells, stairways, ramps, and rampways connect the three main levels of the house.

An assortment of cots, pillows, and bedding periodically line the floor, seemingly placed indiscriminately as to the original purpose of the room they are in. 

I try to enter a bathroom, but the door is obstructed and unable to be pushed in. With great effort, I manage to open it about a foot.

After a careful examination, I identify the obstruction as an unwieldy quagmire of blankets, history books, cooking books, and Filet-O-Fish wrappers.

(Munchy|???, special, crossing, angryMIN, offleft) Hey! What the hell are you doing in my room!

I’m more than startled as I turn around to identify the owner of this apparent domicile.

(Munchy, special, crossing, angryMIN, offleft, slide, center)

It’s Professor Tinyhats!

(Munchy|Munchy, special, squatting, angryMAX) Don’t steal my stuff, you lowly vagrant!

I quickly abscond myself from the situation.

(Munchy, special, squatting, angryMAX, center, slide, offleft)

[Munchy leaves]

The actual inhabitants make up the lion’s share of the aesthetic tone and style of the ‘conference’.

The individuals of the house are comprised of seemingly the most outlandish and eclectic teachers, students, and other extraordinary characters and personalities from the University.

Everyone is participating in an array of recreational activities that run the gamut between calm and casual discourse to what appears to be [i]extreme trampolining[/i] in the backyard. I approach a window near the back to get a closer look at the activity outside.

I see Davoo and his wild and unkempt light-brown hair doing flips and [i]Alley Oop[/i]’s on a large trampoline. The whole situation seems rather precarious as there is no safety net to prevent a dangerous incident.

It doesn’t help that both of the dude’s feet are encased in full orthopedic casts. The whole thing is a rather impressive display of gymnastics and acrobatics. Somehow, despite all this, Davoo continues to bounce as happily as ever. It’s inspiring!

(Davoo, campus, neutral, offright, slide, center)

After about ten minutes he walks back inside and joins everyone else.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, center, slide, offleft)

[Davoo leaves]

People are also playing video games. There’s a few console and PC stations dispersed throughout the house.

(Gibbon, campus, default, neutral, offleft, slide, center)

I notice Gib at one of the PC’s. I walk up behind him and observe his gaming for a short while.

He’s playing what appears to be a high fantasy rpg with orcs, magic spells, and fantastical lands. The graphical fidelity isn’t exactly industry standard, though.

(PCPG) What game is this Gib?

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, handsup, happyMED) This is [i]World of Warcraft Classic[/i]. It finally came out! I’ve been waiting for this for years!

(PCPG) Oh yeah. I think I heard about something like that. I wonder why they would release an older version of their product?

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, shockMIN) The game has changed a lot over the past decade and a half. The gamefeel and audience are completely different now

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, clenched, angryMED) It’s similar to a mobile game in some ways. In the modern [i]WoW[/i], everyone wins, everyone is powerful, and you don’t have to work particularly hard to get anything in the game.

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, confusedMIN) That’s all different in [i]Classic WoW[/i]. In [i]Classic[/i], everything is a pain in the ass.

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, clenched, angryMIN) It takes three hundred hours just to get to max level, every monster can kill you, and you have to work together with people just to complete the most mundane of quests.

(PCPG) That [i]does[/i] sound like a pain in the ass. Why are you playing it then?

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, press, confusedMED) Because it turns out that it’s not very fun to have everything handed to you!

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN) In [i]Classic WoW[/i], all the rewards and milestones are meaningful. It’s satisfying and fulfilling to attain them, because you have to struggle and strive for them all.

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, grabby, happyMED) It’s also a game about community. Teaming up with friends is the only way to overcome many of the challenges.

(PCPG) Wow! I definitely gotta try this game out some time!

I don’t think I would have been saying that three months ago...

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, default, happyMED) [i]Wow[/i] indeed. 

(Gibbon|Gibbon, campus, handsup, smittenMAX) [i]World of Warcraft Classic[/i] is one of my favorite games now!

It’s great to see Gib so impassioned, something I would have found pointless and deplorable at the beginning of the semester.

I let Gib get back to killing [i]worgens[/i] in [i]Shadowfang Keep[/i] and continue my exploration of the various floors, hallways, and chambers of the house.

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, smittenMAX, center, slide, offleft)

[Gibbon leaves]

(Jesse, campus, 3, neutral, offleft, slide, center)

Suddenly, I’m approached by someone.

(Jesse|???, campus, 1, shockMIN) Pretty lame party, am I right or what?!

(PCPG) uhhhhhhhhh…

Isn’t this guy the sewer priest?

(Jesse|Jesse, campus, 1, neutral) Oh sorry. I thought we’d met before. I’m Jesse.

(PCPG) Hello!

(Jesse|Jesse, campus, 4, angryMIN) This whole event is droll and drab. It’s boring as hell!!

I get the impression that Jesse doesn’t know what the word [i]droll[/i] means.

(PCPG) I actually think there’s a lot of super cool people here!

(Jesse|Jesse, campus, 2, confusedMED) Yeah! I was just kidding.

(Jesse|Jesse, campus, 1, happyMED) I wouldn’t say this to their faces, but I consider everyone here my closest friends and I would sacrifice everything and anything for them if I had to.

(Jesse, campus, 1, neutral)

Jesse comes off as an angsty jokester, so this heartfelt sentiment is surprising.

(Jesse|Jesse, campus, 2, shockMED) Anyways, I have to go finish up a project.

(Jesse, campus, 2, shockMED, center, slide, offright)

Jesse turns around and leaves.

[Jesse leaves]

A few individuals are walking around loudly vocalizing personas, skits, and affectations into smartphones and video cameras, apparently vlogging their experience.

(Tom, 2, neutral, offright, slide, center)

One of them is Tom. I overhear a short snippet of what he’s saying. 

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMIN) Hey guys! Just got back from the gym and I'm ready to do some Q and A!

I get the sense that Tom [i]didn’t[/i] just get back from the gym. Oddly enough, I [i]do[/i] sometimes see Tom at the gym in the morning, though.

But I’ve only ever seen him use the showers…

(Tom, 1, neutral, center, slide, offleft)

[Tom leaves]

I walk past a closed door and a distinct, but very familiar, high-pitched lemony scent drifts past my nose. It’s impossible to describe exactly, but I often encounter the same scent when walking past Digi’s office at school...

I decide not to investigate and instead scurry by.

(Jesse, campus, 3, neutral, offleft, left)

I notice Jesse out of the corner of my eye. 

(Jesse, campus, 4, confusedMED)$

He’s entrenched himself on the first floor in a constructed bulwark of rope, wooden planks, and metals against a wall within the atrium of the house. Now I see what he meant by ‘project’.

(Jesse, campus, 3, neutral)$

Directly overlooking him is the next floor up with a wooden railing to separate the second level from the drop down to the first floor.

(Jesse, campus, 4, angryMIN)$

He appears to be surrounding and enclosing himself within an intricate and serpentine system of steel pulleys, thickly-threaded rope, and 2x4 planks of wood.

(Jesse, campus, 4, angryMED)$

The mechanical and wooden contraption creaks and crows as Jesse strains to pull a rope and hoist himself up a few inches. I think he wants to get to the second floor.

(Jesse, campus, 5, shockMED)$

(Mage|Mage, campus, 2, shockMAX, offright, slide, center)

I see the Student Council Vice President, Mage, briskly run over and attempt to guide him to the stairs a couple feet over, but the Sewer Priest remains staunch, stalwart, and steadfast.

(Jesse, campus, 4, angryMED)$

(Mage, campus, 3, confusedMED)

He is determined and resolute in his endeavor.

(Jesse, campus, 4, angryMAX)$

(Mage, campus, 1, angryMIN)

I remember I used to look at people like this and think they were being idiotic, but now I think they are the kings of this world, fording over obstacles and obstructions, and shepherding us through the new frontiers.

(Tom, 1, neutral, offright, right)$

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral, offright, center)

I decide to go outside for some fresh air, and see Tom, Ben, and Nate in a group together, standing rather idly. I walk over.

(PCPG) Hey, guys!

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) Hey PCPG!

(Ben|Ben, campus, base, happyMIN) What’s up, dude.

(Tom|Tom, 1, happyMAX) Yo!

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) I’m so glad you managed to come.

(PCPG) Well I have to admit, it was a tough task getting past Digi at the front door, but I managed to pull it off.

(PCPG) What are you guys waiting around for?

(Ben|Ben, campus, point, happyMIN) Nate’s about to do his lecture. Wish him luck!

(Ben, campus, base, neutral)$

(Tom|Tom, 3, neutral) It’s gonna be lit.

(Tom, 1, neutral)$

I guess the time has finally come.

(PCPG) I’m sure you’re going to do great, Nate!

I see Nate shuffling around the note cards from last night in his hands.

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, neutral|shades) With these cards, I’m sure I’ll be fine.

(Tom|Tom, 1, shockedMAX) You can do it! You’ve just got to [i]believe[/i] in the heart of the cards!

(Tom|Tom, 3, happyMAX) You can do it! Just kick that lecture’s butt!

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) Thanks, guys!

For some reason, Nate is caught in a pensive pause, the same idle and contemplative stare he always does.

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, shockMIN|shades) You know what…

Suddenly, Nate extends the notes out to me.

(Nate|Nate, campus, papers, neutral|shades) How about you just hold on to these for me? I don’t think I’ll need them after all.

(PCPG) What?! But don’t you need these note cards for your lecture?

(Nate|Nate, campus, pointing, happyMED|shades) I don’t need note cards. [b]My friends are my power![/b]

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades, center, slide, offleft)

With that, I grab the cards and he goes off on his way.

Nate’s really quite a great [i]guy[/i]. In fact, he might be [i]the best ever[/i].

After a bit of time everyone starts shuffling toward the lecture hall.

[Nate leaves]

[Location: radprom2]

(Nate, campus, standing, neutral|shades, offright, right)$

(Mage, campus, 5, happyMIN, offleft, center)

Nate is up on stage. Mage is standing before the audience, about to speak.

(Mage|Mage, campus, 4, happyMAX) The first presenter is someone you all should recognize. He’s a tenured professor of philosophy at the local university and has degrees and accreditations from various prestigious academic institutions. He’s also had papers and articles published in a variety of reputable journals and books.--

(Nate, campus, standing, smittenMED|shades, right, slide, center)$

(Mage, campus, 1, happyMED, center, slide, offleft)

Mage finishes the introduction and Nate moves closer to the microphone.

[Mage leaves]

It begins.

(Nate|Nate, campus, standing, happyMED|shades) The [i]Urban Dictionary[/i] definition for [i]sacrifice[/i] is: ‘The act of giving up one's own happiness for the sake of others.’

I can tell this is going to be the start of another incredible Nate lecture.

You got in through a secret window. It was a little precarious carrying your bag of energy drinks from 7-Eleven.

You landed in Professor Bestman’s class, a place you haven’t visited in a while. The sun always seems to be shining through even in the dead of night.

Oh wait. Guess those are just the street lights...

You remember the time when you used to pay voracious attention to Professor Bestman’s lectures.

You used to hate the [i]Urban Dictionary[/i] reading at the start of class, but it eventually became your favorite part…

But you also remember passing out as soon as you got into your desk at the start of class, waking only with the bell or if Tom was nice enough to stir you from sleep.

And then… you also remember simply going home after lunch when you were supposed to be going to this class.

That makes up most of your recent memory…

You could often see his car in the school parking lot late at night, as if he was burning the midnight oil working on whatever latest project.

You noticed this over time as you started to do more late-night adventures when you should’ve been sleeping.

Today, you were too distracted to notice any cars in the parking lot as you came in. The chances of him being in his office are incredibly miniscule...

You would think that the prospect of seeing him now of all times would be just about the worst possible event, but...

You proceed down the hallway, and you look to see if his office light is on…

You grab an energy drink from your white plastic bag and open it on the way to the boundary at the edge of the roof. You hang your arm on the fence while casually taking sips from your beverage.

The view isn’t perfect, but it’s passable.

You can see the alleyway that you use to go to school.

The 7-Eleven you just came from.

The apartment complexes in the distance where many of the professors live...

And you can see the school parking lot.

It’s a pretty quiet town, especially at night, but it’s surprisingly even more muted from up here.

Your thoughts continue to wander.

At no point in your life have you generated as little productive output as you have in the last month, but [i]it[/i] still somehow feels like you were running on fumes. It’s hard to get true, genuine rest.

While you were lost in thought, the liquid in your drink seems to have disappeared. Guess you just blocked out the experience...

You haven’t really enjoyed the taste of energy drinks in a while, but at least it used to be [i]something[/i]. You had a few more drinks planned, but there’s obviously gonna’ be no point.

In the end, it was foolish to think that there’d be anything satisfying or satiating about any of this.

*Call out to Ben.*

You reach into your pocket and take out the ziploc bag of caffeine powder that Ben gave you.

*Call out to Tom.*

You reach into your pocket and take out the ziploc bag of caffeine pills that Tom gave you.

You grab the water bottle you stored in the plastic bag along with the other drinks…

Wait.

[i]sudden bright lights[/i]

The headlights from a car pulling into the parking lot shock you from your stupor. Who’s visiting the school at this hour?

You recognize that car.

(PCPG) Nate!

Tears cascade down your face as you try to gather enough balance to stand up properly and shamble to the door. How did he know you were here?!

You feel completely sick and your body hurts everywhere.

It’s really painful.

It’s hard to see.

The dizziness is making it hard to get anywhere expeditiously, but you finally manage to open the door to the stairs.

For this moment, nothing matters. You want to forget everything and just go see Nate!

You take the first step down the stairs…

Your eyes are so heavy.

It’s hard to tell if you’re even opening them or if you’re just imagining what’s going on.

It feels like a pool of liquid is slowly gathering around the area where your head is touching the ground.

There’s a salty and metallic taste coming from your mouth.

....

It’s really cold.

At least you don’t feel the pain anymore...

You’re so tired…

(Michelle|???, body2, face1, silhouette) You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?

(Michelle|???, body2, face1) There’s no one to blame but yourself.

(Michelle|???, body2, face1) Everyone falls down, and everyone has to decide for themselves whether to get back up...
