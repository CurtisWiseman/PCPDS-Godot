The next day after my morning class I make my way to the school roof. 

I never would’ve guessed you could come up here if Endless War didn’t tell me to meet her here, but the door was totally unlocked.

I wonder what kinda help Endless War even wants from me to realize this plan of hers. Anything I could offer she could just do herself right? 

Maybe its just a case of extra manpower.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral, offleft)
[SLIDE EndlessWar center]
(Endless War|Endless War, stand, neutral) Good, you came early. We should be able to finish this up quickly then.

(PCPG) Woah, hey there EW.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, confusedMIN) Ew no, you don’t get call me that. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, confusedMIN) Don’t think that just cause I called you out here doesn’t mean you are any more special than any other 3tard. Fucking get real.

(PCPG) Okay..

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Anyways, the first task on our list is to obtain some serious capital. The specific parts I need cannot be stolen so easily, so I'm forced to buy them like a fucking plebian.

(PCPG) Parts for what exactly?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, smittenMIN) No need to worry about that. I definitely do not want to bring you along to buy those parts, lest [i]he[/i] becomes untrusting of me.

He?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) The only people I know who has access to the kinda money I need is Professor Digibro and Professor Bestman. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, sadMIN) Professor Digibro is out of the picture because...

(EndlessWar, cross, sadMIN)
And for the first time ever I find Endless War unsure of what to say, almost as though the mere thought of Digi leaves her speechless.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, sadMED) ...he just.. doesn't.. get it for some reason, you know?

I’m not sure what [i]it[/i] exactly is, but I nonetheless agree. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) And besides, through the WAR I have cooperated with Professor Bestman to gain a profit, so he will no doubt be easier to convince of this regardless. 

(PCPG) So, not to push any responsibility off myself here, but why do you need me then?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) You will provide backup to the conversation, a second voice to show that I am not acting alone. It’s simple psychology really.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) You will however watch what you say. I don’t want you fucking this up for me, is that understood?

(PCPG) Uh, yes ma'am.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Good. Stay obedient like that and we’ll both have a swell ol time together. Lets go.

[EndlessWar leaves]
[Location: hallway2]

Endless War then makes her way down the stairs and I follow. 

This plan of hers seems a lot more sketchy than I originally thought. Is she building something with those parts? How will that start a new age of WAR?

We enter the Meme’s classroom and find the professor at his desk.

(EndlessWar, cross, neutral, offright)
[SLIDE EndlessWar right+200]
(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral, right+100) Professor Bestman, a word?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, happyMED|shades, left) Oh but of course, anything for my favourite student council president, but uhh..

(Nate, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left)
Professor Bestman nods over in my direction worryingly.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral, right+100) Don't worry, he's with me.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left) I see.. 

[SLIDE EndlessWar center+200]
Professor Bestman continues worryingly watch me as I walk into the classroom, the same look one would give to someone asking for a drink when they clearly have drunk too much.

I ignore it, I know what I’m doing here.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, neutral|shades, left) So, what’s up EW?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) I have another.. proposition for you. This one is on a much grander scale though.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades, left) Oh? You have my interest peaked.

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) I have information from a.. reliable source that may benefit you immensely in the long run, but..

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, confusedMIN|shades, left) I'm guessing you want something in exchange for this information now?

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, neutral) Precisely. An investment if you will. I will need an amount equivalent to six sextillion SlimeCoin.

Holy slime! Six sextillion SlimeCoin?! /n
Does Professor Bestman even have that kinda money?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades, left) Hmm, that is quite the sum. I assume you can't tell me anything else about it until I accept?

(Endless War|Endless War, cross, happyMIN) Correct. I see you understand my predicament professor. I'd rather not kill you if you refuse, I like you that much at least.

The professor pauses at the compliment.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, sadMIN|shades, left) Of course. Listen, I would love to help you out here, but I need more insurance than just your word, given the amount of money you’re asking here.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, pointing, neutral|shades, left) Convince me. Convince me that this is worth my money and that I will inevitably gain from this, else it’s gotta be a no from me dawg.

(Endless War, stand, neutral)
Endless War pauses to formulate her argument, but I bet I could give a good reason for him to help us out. Should I try to convince Professor Bestman myself?

[CHOICE]

*Try to convince him yourself*
*Let Endless War do the convincing*

*Try to convince him yourself*

(PCPG) Actually, if I may, I think the best kind of insurance for yourself here is past experience. 

(PCPG) You already make money off the WAR, and I assume when the WAR is good you make more, no?

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, angryMIN)
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, neutral|shades, left)
Endless War gives me a wary look while the professor agrees to my question.

(PCPG) What Endless War and I are trying to do here is to simply make the WAR gooder more often and to higher extents. 

(PCPG) Our plan aims to elevate the current status of the WAR, which would surely require new services and products, a prime opportunity to gain big, wouldn’t you say?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, neutral|shades, left) Hmm, you do make some good points there PCPG. The WAR has indeed been a massively successful venture so far, but..

(Nate, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left)
(Endless War, stand, angryMED)
Professor Bestman then goes quiet. There better not be a “no” behind that “but” else I may not make it out of this classroom in one piece.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, happyMED|shades, left) Nah, nevermind. Endless War, you have never failed me before with your ideas so I don’t see why you would now either. /n
Sure, I will accept your offer.

(Endless War, stand, happyMIN)
Oh thank slime itself, I live to see another day.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, neutral|shades, left) However, my only requirement is that you will need to tell me that useful information right now so that I may capitalize on it as efficiently as possible.

(Endless War|Endless War, cross, happyMIN) Oh, but of course. 

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) In the next few days there will be an incredible spike in demand for slime not only in this city, but worldwide, and all related slime industries will skyrocket in stocks. 

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, neutral) Ride that wave and you will be set for life.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, confusedMIN|shades, left) Slime demand [i]worldwide[/i] huh? Are you sure about this?

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, neutral) Absolutely certain.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, confusedMIN|shades, left) Hmm, I better tell Slimecorp then...

(Nate, campus, smoking, confusedMED|shades, left)
Professor Bestman furrows his eyebrows in thought for a few seconds.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades, left) Well, this has been a productive conversation, but excuse me, I need to make a very important phone call.

[SLIDE Nate offright]
[SLIDE EndlessWar center]
With that the professor leaves the classroom, and I sigh in relief.

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, neutral) You were lucky this time, but don’t butt in like that again, cause if you ever manage to fuck something up for me..

(Endless War|Endless War, knife, angryMIN)
She brandishes her knife at me menacingly. I think I get the idea.
*

*Let Endless War do the convincing*

I stay silent and let Endless War talk.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Well consider this Nate, your success in the WAR has been closely tied to me for a while now. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Imagine if I hadn’t told you to take an interest in Nickelodeon when I had, you wouldn’t be where you are now where I have to ask you for help.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, smoking, neutral|shades, left) I suppose that is true..

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) It would be a shame then if you lost access to such a useful resource because of a simple disagreement, no?

[StopMusic]
(Nate, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left)
Professor Bestman begins to visibly sweat.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left) Yeah.. that would suck balls..

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMED) And so wouldn’t it be in your best interest not to engage in simple disagreements with such a person who is so influential to your success? 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMED) Who not only is key to continuing that success, but also the continuation of your comfortable life?

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left) Uhh, yeah I think I understand what you’re getting at here, but..

(EndlessWar, knife, angryMAX)
Professor Bestman takes a moment to consider his words while Endless War reaches her breaking point. 

If Professor Bestman doesn’t accept her offer I don’t think even I will make it out of this classroom in one piece.

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, sadMIN|shades, left) I.. think I indeed do owe you for getting me to where I am now, so I’ll.. accept your offer.

[Song: PCPDating_ClassMemes_Megalovania]

[SLIDE Nate offright]
With that the professor hurriedly makes his way out of the classroom and I sigh in relief. Why does Endless War have to make everything so tense?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral, center+300, slide, center) I mean you could’ve said something, anything to help me convince him there, but I suppose you didn’t fuck it all up either, so I guess that's fine.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Anyways, we still have a few more things to do today. Follow me to the cafeteria.

[EndlessWar leaves]
And with that we make our way out of the classroom. Never a dull moment with Endless War around huh?

[fade from black]

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, neutral) Okay, so next we need to find something, or rather, [i]someone[/i].

(PCPG) Woah wait a second Endless War, can’t we take a break for a minute? That was pretty nerve wracking back there and now we’re just immediately jumping into the next thing.

(PCPG) Maybe we could, oh I don’t know, grab a coffee together or something?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, confusedMIN) ...

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, confusedMED) Are you.. trying to hit on me?

(PCPG) Uhh...

I mean, I wasn’t considering it at first, but now I definitely am. Endless War [i]is[/i] quite attractive.

Hmm... do I even dare try it?

[CHOICE]
*!date Endless War*
*Don't bother*

*!date Endless War*
(PCPG) !date En-

*Don't bother*
(PCPG) No, I would n-

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) First off, thats fucking disgusting, why would I ever !date [i]you[/i]? Better luck in your dreams 3tard.

(Endless War|Endless War, cross, angryMIN) Secondly, a fucking coffee? What kind of boring shitty ideas do you have in there? At least ask for a bomb ass milkshake or something like that, that’s way more romantic.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMED) If you want to fuck around with dates and cute bullshit go hang out with Mage, I’m sure she’d love it. If you want to help me change the [i]fucking world[/i] then stick around.

(PCPG) Yeah sorry, nevermind, I’m sorry I even brought it up. Let’s just focus on what's at hand.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Okay so as I was saying, we are looking for a specific student.

(PCPG) Who?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) Not sure of their name yet, but I have good information that they can be extremely helpful to our cause.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) I’ll look around for their description, you just stay here until I find them and then I’ll tell you what we need to do.

(PCPG) Okay...

[EndlessWar leaves]
Endless War then goes around the cafeteria and scans the students present.

Most of the school population does have their lunch here, but it’s not a guaranteed place to find someone.

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Damn it, they aren’t here. I guess we’ll have to pass by the classrooms.

(Endless War, stand, neutral, center, slide, right) 
But before we manage to leave, a familiar face stops us in our tracks.

(EndlessWar, stand, angryMIN)
(Mage, campus, 4, confusedMIN, offleft, slide, left) Hey Endless War and.. PCPG?

(Mage, campus, 1, sadMIN)
Mage gives me the same worrying look Professor Bestman did.

(Mage, campus, 5, confusedMIN) What are you doing with.. her?

(PCPG) Oh we-

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) That’s none of your business Mage. What do you want?

(Mage, campus, 3, angryMIN) Stop skipping student council meetings EW! This is the last time I'll let you get away with it! 

(Mage, campus, 3, angryMED) You can’t possibly expect us to do everything without the president herself?!

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) Holy shit Mage most of our meetings are useless boring bullshit that nobody cares about! 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMED, right, slide, right-200) Now move before I move you myself.

(Mage, campus, 2, angryMED, left, slide, left+200) I’d like to see you try.

The air crackles with energy as both girls stare each other down. I better stop them before this gets nasty.

(PCPG) Woah hey let’s just chill for a second. How about a compromise, alright?

(EndlessWar, knife, angryMIN)
(Mage, campus, 2, angryMIN) What sort of compromise?

(PCPG) Well uhh, maybe.. maybe let Endless War skip this meeting, but then make her promise to attend the following ones until the end of year. How does that sound?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMED) Ooh, I like that as a compromise. How about it, [i]vice president Mage[/i]?

(Mage, campus, 5, angryMIN) ...

(Mage, campus, 4, neutral) Fine, but this is not looking good for you with the student council election so close now.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Oh, I’m not worried about that in the slightest.

(Mage, campus, 5, angryMIN) We’ll see about that..

[Mage leaves]
Mage then disappears into the cafeteria crowd as we make our way out to the hallways.

[Location: hallway1.percyjackson]

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN, right-200, slide, center) On slime itself, sometimes Mage can be such an annoying bitch. /n
I much prefer hanging out with her alternate self, though she is rarely around nowadays.

Mage’s alternate self?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, happyMIN) Nice thinking back there by the way. After we’re done today there won’t be student council meetings to attend, so that compromise works out perfectly for me.

I wasn’t really thinking of that, but I guess she’s right. /n
Hmm, but..

(PCPG) Why did you become student council president if you didn’t want to attend the meetings though? Isn’t that like the whole point?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Oh silly PCPG, power is not an easy thing to get, and being the student council president is an easy way to gain a lot of power. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, happyMIN) There’s all kinds of things you can do with a position like mine..

(PCPG) Like what?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Well, maybe if you attended this school longer you would see for yourself, but enough talking, we should continue our search.

[fade to black]
[EndlessWar leaves]
[Location: hallway2]
[StopMusic]
[Song: PCPDating_DateTheme]
[fade from black]

We spend most of the rest of lunch searching the classrooms with no success.

Endless War said we are looking for a student with "unique properties," though in my mind that could really apply to anyone in this place.

I decide to strike up a conversation to occupy us as we head on the next class over.

(EndlessWar, stand, neutral)
(PCPG) So I was wondering, what made you think of this plan anyways? To start a new age of WAR?

(PCPG) Not to say you couldn’t have just been stricken with inspiration out of the blue, but it all seems pretty elaborate for that to be the case.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, sadMIN) It’s...

Endless War pauses for a moment. I didn’t expect her to consider my question so seriously, so this deliberation catches me off guard.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, sadMIN) Well, someone.. found me, and gave me the idea. He even offered to sell me some of those parts I needed that would be difficult to obtain otherwise.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, sadMIN) I felt like I had met him before, a long time before, which is why I humoured his suggestion at first.

(PCPG) Someone?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) He called himself krak. He seemed like a Killer to me, but I’ve never seen him around them before. Don’t know much else about him though...

(PCPG) Huh, interesting..

Who is this mysterious krak? And why is he so interested in this new age of WAR? Maybe there is more to this WAR thing than I originally realized...

(EndlessWar, stand, neutral)
Finding nothing else to add to the conversation we both silently continue walking down the hallway, until Endless War suddenly stops in front of the science classroom ahead of me.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN, center, slide, center+300) There we go. Found him.

(PCPG) Sweet! Okay so what’s the plan now?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, confusedMIN) Hmm..

Endless War stands there motionless as she stares into the classroom.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Actually, I thought I was gonna need your help for this, but it may be a better idea to do this myself...

(PCPG) Oh. Uhh okay, so what should I do then?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) We still have one more task to perform after this.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Meet me after school near the alleyways around campus. There will be a large manhole cover next to a yellowish building, wait for me there.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Don’t fucking leave if I don’t come right after school. I’ll be busy with something.

(PCPG) Okay, got it.

[EndlessWar leaves]
Endless War then makes her way into the science classroom and shuts the door behind her. What exactly is she planning to do with this student? Who even are they?

I find myself with too many questions that I just can't answer. Endless War is just so secretive about this whole thing it's getting hard to trust her.

With no clear answers in sight I decide to think about it another time and make my way to my next class.

[fade to black]
[StopMusic]

[Scene: An Offering of Slime]

[Song: PCPDating_HomeNight]
[Location: waytoschool.nojesse]
[fade from black]

After school I arrive near the alleyways and find the manhole Endless War was talking about, but no Endless War. I guess I'll just wait for her to arrive...

[fade to black]
[Location: waytoschool.night]
[fade from black]

The day eventually turns into night and yet no sign of her is to be seen. At this point I get the feeling that maybe I’ve been ditched, it sadly wouldn’t be the first time.

As I’m debating whether or not to leave the devil herself finally arrives.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral, offleft, slide, center) Good, you’re still here. I do not want to do this myself.

(PCPG) Uhh, so like where were you for the past several hours?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) I fucking told you I was going to be busy. It just turns out that the whole process was a little more.. complicated than I originally thought.

(PCPG) What process?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) None of your business. Open up the manhole already and start climbing down.

(PCPG) Wait, we’re going down there?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) What else would we do here you retard? Go down already!

I approach the manhole and, after taking a few seconds to find a good grip, heave it open. I take a look inside. 

It is very dark down there, the manhole ladder disappearing into a sea of black punctuated only by a faint green glow from the bottom.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMED) What are you waiting for? Go!

I tentatively make my way down the ladder.

[EndlessWar leaves]
[StopMusic]
[Song: PCPDating_BotBustah]
[Location: sewers]

Woah, this is not what I expected the sewers to look like. I did expect this smell however, which is absolutely vile. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Okay, so we are looking for a specific valve to twist open. It should look out of place, different from the rest of these valves. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) It's part of my personal addition to more directly connect the grand canyon to the sewer system of Boston.

(PCPG) The grand canyon? Why would you want to connect the grand canyon to the sewer system?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, confusedMIN) Oh, you don’t know? I guess CERN did cover it up quite well.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) Due to a freak accident that happened at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, the grand canyon next to us surprisingly started to fill up with radioactive ooze. 

(PCPG) Woah, that's pretty wild. What caused the accident?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) Nobody really knows, but an unattended station during a tour visit seems to be the most likely explanation. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) CERN clearly didn’t want their mistake to be publicized though, so I’m sure there’s more to it than just that.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Anyways, we should get started. I forget the layout of this place so we’ll just have to walk around to find it.

[EndlessWar leaves]
We start our trek down a random path and begin our search.

[fade to black]
[fade from black]

About an hour passes of us getting lost in the intricate sewer system and soon the bright green all around us is starting to make me feel green too.

(EndlessWar, stand, neutral)
(PCPG) So like, what is this radioactive ooze stuff anyways?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Fuck if I know, but it can be refined into the slime that we all know and love.

(PCPG) This is what slime is made out of? 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Yeah, basically. In fact I refine it myself, for reviving people of course.

(PCPG) Reviving people?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Oh fucking hell. Yes of course you can revive people, how else has this bloody WAR gone on for so long with our small student population?

(PCPG) I.. guess I never really thought about it too hard.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Oh, of course you haven’t. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMED) I put all of this work into infusing everyone’s DNA with slime and setting up all these fucking systems behind the scenes and nobody even gives a single slimeoid shit!

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMED) Fuck all of you ungrateful fucks!

I guess that was a hot button to press there.

(PCPG) Uhh... sooo, how do you make slime then?

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) Didn’t you just hear me? You don’t [i]make[/i] it. All I do is take this stuff, clean it of impurities using a complicated process called using a fucking filter, and voila, slime.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) The only issue with it is that to refine enough slime to be useful takes either a long time or a large amount of effort. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) That’s one thing I’m aiming to fix with this new change to the WAR.

(PCPG) That sounds like a lot of work, surely there must be an easier way to obtain slime, right?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, confusedMED) What? Of course there isn't. Why the fuck would you know more about this than me?

(PCPG) Hmm, let me try something though...

(PCPG) !harvest slime

[StopMusic]
Suddenly I feel as though I have made the worst mistake of my life. May the slime gods above have mercy on my soul.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMAX) [b]HARVEST IS NOT A COMMAND YOU FUCKING IDIOT[/b]

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMAX) STOP FUCKING AROUND AND FIND THIS GODDAMN VALVE ALREADY BEFORE I END YOU!

[Song: PCPDating_BotBustah]
[EndlessWar leaves]
Endless War then walks on ahead of me in anger. I decide to shut up and continue our search before I accidentally trip on another landmine of hers. 

[fade to black]
[fade from black]

It takes nearly another two hours to find the valve in this maze of tunnels, but we eventually do. We find it underneath a large pipe jutting out of the ceiling.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Holy slime finally. Okay, now twist it counterclockwise until you can’t move it anymore.

(PCPG) Aren’t you like way stronger than me? Why don’t you twist it?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) Just fucking do it!

(PCPG) Okay alright, was just asking.

(EndlessWar, stand, neutral)
I approach the valve, but as soon as I place my hands on it Endless War begins to slowly back away.

[SLIDE EndlessWar right-200]
(PCPG) Where are you going?

[SLIDE EndlessWar right+200]
Endless War ignores my question and continues to move back. Afraid to anger her further I get to work and begin twisting the valve. 

[SLIDE EndlessWar offright]
At first it is incredibly tight, but soon enough the valve loosens and I begin to twist it faster and faster until it suddenly stops. 

I shout out to Endless War who is now quite far away from me.

(PCPG) Okay, that should be it. What now?

(Endless War) Now, you have fun.

Before I can decipher what she meant a torrent of radioactive ooze juts out of the pipe above me, pushing me to the ground and nearly washing me away into the ooze stream below. 

After desperately struggling to escape the torrent I finally manage to crawl towards dry land, and find myself right next to a laughing Endless War.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMAX, center) AHAHAHA you fucking idiot, what did you think was gonna happen?!

(PCPG) Well, thanks for that, I now see why you wanted me to do this. 

(PCPG) Uhh, should I be worried that I am now covered in literal radioactive goo?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMED) Nah not really. This stuff basically brings people back to life, remember? It can’t be that bad for you.

(PCPG) I suppose so..

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Well, that’s all we need to do. All that's left is the ceremony itself.

(PCPG) The ceremony?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) This is a big event, surely we must have a ceremony to announce it’s beginning. It’s only appropriate.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Your final task is to bring Munchy and Ben alongside the Rowdies and Killers to the Bunker Hill monument tomorrow morning so that we can all start the ceremony together.

(PCPG) Why there?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, neutral) I like the place. I feel a sense of.. kinship to the monument I suppose. 

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Anyways, have yourself a peaceful evening PCPG, might as well enjoy your last one.

[EndlessWar leaves]
With that Endless War walks away down the way we came, leaving me soaked and lost down here. My last peaceful evening huh?

[fade to black]
[StopMusic]

[Scene: The Ritual]

The next morning I try to convince both gangs to join us for the ceremony, despite both gangs absolutely hating my guts by this point. 

After avoiding a few close calls to my life, I finally manage to get both Ben and Munchy to agree, and alongside them I make my way over to the Bunker Hill monument.

(Ben, casual, base, neutral, offleft)
(Munchy, campus, default, neutral, offright)
[SLIDE Ben left-150]
[SLIDE Munchy right+100]
We arrive at the monument and find Endless War excitedly waiting for us in front of a white tarp covering something.. very big.

(PCPG) What's going on? What’s behind you?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral)
[SLIDE EndlessWar center]
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Rowdys! Killers! I think it is high time for a new chapter of our glorious WAR. The current state of affairs is so dull and so so boring, and I think it's all your fault. 
 
(Ben, casual, base, shockMIN)
(Munchy, campus, crossing, angryMIN)
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) You pride yourself on violence and murder yet all of you only really get away with are single digit deaths by end of one of your childish scuffles. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) I think I’ve had enough babysitting your sorry asses, it's time for you to murder like never before!
 
She looks at Munchy.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Imagine if you can take all of your pent up anger and frustration and display it to an endless stream of Killers ready to be !killed at your command.

(Munchy, campus, default, happyMIN)
She turns to face Ben.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) Imagine if we could keep mowing down Rowdies and ignorant juvies with those guns of yours without end or interruption.

(Ben, casual, base, happyMIN)
Ben and Munchy salivate at her propositions.
 
(Ben, casual, point, happyMIN) Well, what are you suggesting then?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) You see, to truly engage in WAR, absolutely everyone needs to first forgo thier useless mortal bodies in preference of something.. slimier.

(Ben, casual, base, happyMIN|cloud)
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) But of course I get fucking stuck with the task to infuse slime into everyone, and you know how much fucking work that is?

Endless War takes a deep sigh.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, happyMIN) We secondly need to indoctrinate everyone to the violence and bloodshed. To leave no person without the instinct to kill. No child without a deadly weapon and the will to use it.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, happyMED) I wish for a world with no society, no schools, no rules. A world where the only thing that matters is kill or be killed, a world where the only thing on people’s mind is WAR.

Huh, that sounds a lot like that ever so popular branch of politics, anarcho-facism™.

(Ben, casual, base, happyMIN)
(Endless War|Endless War, knife, happyMIN) To achieve this end, I have procured the perfect set of ingredients and circumstances.

(Ben, casual, base, neutral)
(Munchy, campus, crossing, neutral)
(EndlessWar, stand, happyMIN)
[SLIDE EndlessWar center-250]
She then pulls down the tarp behind her revealing a monstrosity of a machine, with a nigh endless amount of pipes, wires, and machinery all caved in on each other. 

In the middle of the machine is a seat, and strapped to that seat, is a gagged Davoo?

(EndlessWar, stand, happyMED)
(Ben, casual, base, shockedMIN)
(Munchy, campus, default, shockedMIN)
(Davoo, neutral, shockedMAX, center+100) Mhhhmmmmm!!

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, happyMED) You see I discovered that our lovely student Davoo here has two interesting properties which will allow this all to work ever so smoothly. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, happyMIN) Firstly, Davoo is goo, and thus on a molecular level has already forgone his fleshy body.

(Davoo, neutral, shockedMIN, center+100)
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) If we can replicate that to the rest of humanity, we could similarly achieve true immortality without the tedious need to infuse slime into everyones bodies.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, happyMED) But even better than that, he appears to contain a collective in and of himself, and that got me thinking of how useful that is. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, cross, happyMIN) Imagine everyone not only being immortal, but also part of a collective voice that will shout at them to fight endlessly. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Instead of trying to indoctrinate you to violence through conventional means, I can simply BE you.
 
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN) By hooking him up to this expensive machine, which is hooked up to the large amount of radioactive ooze in the grand canyon via the the intricate sewer system of Boston.. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMED) ..I can refine all that waste into slime and infuse it into every possible DNA-like structure there is!

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) This will not only transform everything into perfect immortal killing machines, but will change the very essence of this country, nay the entire world, to not only be at WAR..

[CG: Endless Eye]

(Endless War) ..but ENDLESS WAR!

(Endless War) AHAHAHAHA!!!!

(Endless War, stand, happyMAX)
(Ben, casual, base, happyMIN)
(Munchy, campus, default, happyMED)
[CG end]

Endless War continues to laugh as the crowd around us watches with glee, shock, and awe at her revelation.
 
(PCPG) But, what will happen to Davoo then?
 
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, neutral) Eh I don’t know, he’ll probably be consumed into the collective losing his individual self, but who cares, this is for the greater good.

(Ben, casual, base, neutral)
(Munchy, campus, default, neutral)
(Davoo, neutral, shockedMAX) MMMMMNNNNN!!!!
 
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMIN)
She chuckles at this final remark and pulls out a complicated looking remote with a cartoonishly large switch out of her pocket.
 
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, happyMED) With a singular flip, the world will be changed, nay improved into something far greater, but of course, I will not do it without the consent of both the gang leaders.

(Davoo, neutral, shockedMIN)
(Ben, casual, base, happyMIN)
(Munchy, campus, default, happyMED)
(Endless War|Endless War, stand, happyMED) Munchy. Ben. Are you both ready for a new age of WAR? Are you ready for ENDLESS WAR?

Munchy and Ben look at each other, each with a devious glint in their eyes. Seems like they are down for ENDLESS WAR, but am I?
 
[CHOICE]
 
*Sacrifice Davoo for ENDLESS WAR*
*Stop ENDLESS WAR and save Davoo*
 
*Sacrifice Davoo for ENDLESS WAR*

I’m sorry Davoo, but progress requires sacrifices. This is for the greater good.
 
(Ben, casual, base, happyMAX)
(Munchy, campus, squatting, happyMAX) 
(Ben and Munchy) HELL YEAH! FLIP THAT SWITCH BITCH!

(EndlessWar, stand, smittenMED|blushMIN)
(Davoo, neutral, shockedMAX)
Endless War promptly complies and soon the machine behind her whirs into life as it sucks radioactive ooze from below and churns it into slime.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, smittenMED|blushMED) AHAHAHA!! LET THE NEW AGE OF ENDLESS WAR BEGIN!!!

[StopMusic]
[Music: PCP-AMBIENT_Earthquake]

The machine begins to speed up faster and faster, enough so that it almost seems like it will break apart at its hinges. 

Then just before it seems like everything will explode, the machine begins to turn in on itself, almost as though it’s falling into the tall monument behind it.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, smittenMED|blushMIN) And for the final ingredient! 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, smittenMED|blushMED) One who must sacrifice themselves so that the collective can function as one, who can incessantly chant to violence endlessly, a leader to direct this world to ENDLESS WAR!

(Endless War|Endless War, stand, smittenMAX|blushMAX) ME! Endless War!

[Davoo leaves]
[EndlessWar leaves]

Endless War then jumps into the collapsing machine and along with Davoo is sucked into the monument itself. 

[Location: Bunker Hill Monument.eye]

The monument then morphs and changes with the machine until they are fully combined as one, as a single entity. 

The monument, nay Endless War herself, then begins to quietly chant, drowning all other thoughts I may have had.

[Munchy leaves]

[StopMusic]

And then without warning, everything goes white.

[Scene: ENDLESS WAR]
[Song: PCPDating_ProCrastinatorShortLoop]
[Location: 7eleven.nightmare]

It’s been several months since that fateful day, and true to Endless War’s words, the world has dramatically changed, nay improved, from what it was.

[fade from black]

ENDLESS WAR has now spanned across the entire world, inviting everyone to kill each other to gain the new main currency, the ever so valuable slime. 

People, animals, objects, everything has been affixed by this new curse of slimeification, and now our immortal bodies can kill each other endlessly like she always wanted.

[Location: hallway2.dream]

Schools, businesses, and world governments have effectively come to a halt, though there is talk of a corporation that will rise up to take advantage of our new situation.

I guess time will tell on that front.

[Location: outsidepcpu.nightmare]

As for me? I kill endlessly alongside everyone else and honestly, it’s surprisingly a pretty great time.

I switch between gangs from time to time, trying out what both have to offer, and in doing so have gained many friendships.

Despite all the violence around me, I feel more welcome in this city now than ever.

[Location: Bunker Hill Monument.eye]

I still don’t know what exactly happened to Davoo or Endless War. 

I can only assume that she was right and they both got consumed into the collective and are now fueling our desire to kill.

I visit them here every so often hoping to figure it out. Unfortunately, all that is left is a single eye, looking down upon us from the very top of the monument.

Maybe that’s her, Endless War herself, watching over us all as we live in the kind of world she envisioned for us. In her new age of WAR.

I’d like to think so.

*Stop ENDLESS WAR and save Davoo*

I knew Endless War wasn't to be trusted. Trying to stop her now probably isn't gonna end well for me, but it's the right thing to do.

Before Ben and Munchy can answer her I make a jump towards the remote in her hands and manage to knock it off of her. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, shockedMIN)
(Ben, casual, base, shockedMIN)
(Munchy, campus, default, shockedMIN) 
The remote drops it onto the floor and luckily breaks open, scattering it’s innards all over the concrete.

(Ben, casual, base, shockedMAX)
(Munchy, campus, default, shockedMED)
(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, shockedMED) YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

[Davoo leaves]
The restraints on Davoo then suddenly unlock and he immediately makes a break for it.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, shockedMAX) BEN! MUNCHY! AFTER HIM! NOW!!

(Ben, casual, base, angryMAX)
(Munchy, campus, default, angryMED)
[Ben leaves]
[Munchy leaves]
Ben and Munchy alongside their gangs promptly chase after Davoo. Endless War then turns to face me.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, neutral)
[SLIDE EndlessWar center]
(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) So after everything we did together, you decide now is when you’ll try and stop me?

(PCPG) ...

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMED) You think you’re so smart right now huh? What do you honestly think is going to happen next though? Did you somehow think you could stop my glorious plan?

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMIN) I'll tell you what will happen next. Davoo will soon be captured again, I will manage to fix my remote, and the new age of WAR will then begin anew.

[StopMusic]
(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMAX) The only difference now is that you won't get to see it!

[Song: PCP-AMBIENT_Earthquake]

But before Endless War can approach me, the ground starts to shake.

(EndlessWar, knife, confusedMIN)
(PCPG) Uhh, what is happening?

Endless War then turns to look at the machine behind here and finds it vibrating at a rapid rate. 

(EndlessWar, knife, shockedMED)
The various pipes that hold the machine together begin to leak with radioactive ooze and sparks begin to fly between the various electronics.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, shockedMIN) No. NO FUCK!

[EndlessWar leaves]
Endless War rushes to the remote and tries to piece it back together as the machine continues whirring up, seemingly breaking itself down as a result. 

Maybe the machine is trying to activate but because Davoo isn’t here nothing is functioning properly?

(Endless War) Fucking stop you piece of shit!

[StopMusic]
[SFX: PCP-SFX_Nuke]
[cut to black]

Suddenly the machine gives in and explodes, knocking us both to the ground.

[pause]

(EndlessWar, stand, sadMIN)
[fade from black]

I open my eyes and find Endless War already up, staring down at the smoking pile of ooze, metal, and electronics. She seems almost... sad. 

I try and stand up.

(EndlessWar, stand, sadMED) Shit..

(EndlessWar, stand, angryMED)
She then quickly turns around and runs straight at me, but before I can react she..

[SFX: PCP-SFX_KatanaSlash]
[Song: PCPDating_GameOver]
(Endless War, knife, angryMAX)
[Location: Bunker Hill Monument, overlay.bloodsplatter]

..stabs me in the stomach. She then pulls her knife back out and I fall onto the floor, my blood mixing with the burnt radioactive ooze. 

[Location: Bunker Hill Monument]
(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, angryMAX) Oh right, I never did end up infusing you with slime. All [i]you've[/i] got is this useless fucking blood.

Well, this is the end of the road for me, hopefully Davoo managed to escape or hide somewhere by now.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMIN) PCPG, you must understand, there is no stopping true progress, you can only halt it. 

(EndlessWar|Endless War, stand, angryMED) ENDLESS WAR will happen! It has to! With or without you.

(EndlessWar|Endless War, knife, sadMED) Hopefully you will instead enjoy this final death of yours, you’ll be one of the final few who do.

[cut to black]
[SFX: PCP-SFX_KatanaSlash]
Endless War then brings her knife down on me one more time, and the world goes black.

This [i]was[/i] the right thing to do, right?
