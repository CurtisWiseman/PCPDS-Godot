So far I’ve been doing a pretty alright job on the actually-give-a-crap-about-school-front. 

I’ve attended as many classes as are chronologically attendable, done extra research on the side and, oh yeah, I have essentially stopped sleeping. 

The things you do for the respect of your peers.

(Davoo, hazmat, curious, offleft, slide, center) Hey PCPG. Don’t turn around, don’t look suspicious, okay?
 
He sure isn’t one to talk. What the hell is going on with that outfit?

(PCPG) I wasn’t planning on looking suspicious. Why?
 
(Davoo, hazmat, thinking) So, what I  am about to say will sound weird, but there’s actually a very logical and important reason as to why you need to hear it; 

(Davoo, hazmat, thinking) You’re the person in this room I distrust the least, and that’s not even mentioning the fact that this is about your textbook.

(Davoo, hazmat, curious) So swear that you won’t tell a soul.

What am I not supposed to tell anyone? I really need some sleep. Still, there’s something deeply unnerving about someone in your vicinity wearing a hazmat suit while you are not. 

It incites both a strong urge to get away as quickly as possible and to do exactly what the people in protective outfits say.
 
(PCPG) No problem. Now tell me, what about my textbook warrants that kind of disclaimer?
 
(Davoo, hazmat, curious) Okay, so see that paragraph about the influence of Isao Takahata on the industry?
 
(PCPG) No?
 
(Davoo, hazmat, ShockedMIN) Yeah well is should be there, but instead you just have that block of Japanese text.

He’s right, but the Japanese is really off. The grammar is a trainwreck.

(PCPG) That’s not even real Japanese, It looks like someone ran it through Google Translate.

(Davoo, hazmat, shockedMAX) And can you read Japanese?
 
(PCPG) Of course I can’t fucking read Japanese.
 
(Davoo, hazmat, confusedMIN) Then how did you know it was wrong, ya face?
 
(PCPG) I don’t know, I just did…

(PCPG) ...Hey, now the text is insulting me!
 
(Davoo, hazmat, neutral) Yeah, they do that sometimes when they’re found out.
 
It’s almost like Davoo is deliberately trying to be unclear and slowly I’m beginning to panic./n
The yellow suit still isn’t helping.

(PCPG) Who does?
 
(Davoo, hazmat, curious) Give me your book.
 
(PCPG) I’m freaking the fuck out here, so either tell me what’s going on, or I’m gonna look so fucking suspicious as to be arrested immediately by some sort of shifty-eye-taskforce.

(PCPG) An ill-defined authority, responding to my facial expression alone.
 
(Davoo, hazmat, neutral) Your book is atominous, and there’ll be like serious fucking consequences to your health if you hold on to it.

(Davoo, hazmat, angryMIN) I can explain all of this bullshit to you after class, but for now just give me the damn book.
 
Worried about my physical wellbeing and hoping that I didn’t fall asleep during class, I hand over my book, 

which is promptly disposed of in what Davoo refers to as an “atominous containment book shredder.”

(Davoo, campus, fidgeting)
 
(PCPG) Okay, I’m assuming this has something to do with that incident in science class. What’s going on?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, shockMIN) Yeah, it’s pretty much exactly that. Atominous are particles that are… well, autonomous. 

(Davoo, campus, explaining, shockMIN) They corrupt regular matter and try to pass for the genuine article, or adapt to reality, or something, but they are incredibly bad at it.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Like awful.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) But that doesn’t make them any less dangerous. 

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) Actually, the flawed nature of their adaptations in regards to the rules laid out by standard physics is what makes them such a threat in the first place.
 
(PCPG) So what can they do?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Anything. I don’t mean autonomous in the way a person would be, doing what you want to but within like the framework of physical possibility. 

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) No, actually autonomous.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Completely independent of all frameworks and breaking laws of physics that we haven’t even conceived of yet or potentially aren’t even capable of conceiving of.
 
Maybe the intense sleep deprivation is messing with my ability to fully comprehend the cosmic horror inherent in that concept on a visceral level, but I’m really not feeling scared as much as morbidly curious.
 
(PCPG) Okay, it’s not like I’m not believing you, I am, but if that’s true, shouldn’t someone be taking care of this who isn’t just a regular-ass student?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, angryMIN) Oh sure, the atominous control unit would be all over this place, shutting down the school and running around in oversized hazmat suits.
 
(PCPG) Then why aren’t they?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, angryMIN) I’m not gonna let this school get shut down when I can take care of this crap myself. I’m not afraid of friggin’ textbooks.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, angryMIN) I’m a professional.
 
(PCPG) Meaning that your personal interest in anime history keeps you from divulging info about a dangerous infestation to experts.
 
(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) Well it’s not dangerous if I’m taking care of it, is it? Are you gonna stop me?
 
(PCPG) No, I’m just pointing out a pretty ridiculous behavioral pattern that I find far too fascinating to intervene in. I was actually gonna offer my assistance.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, shockMAX) Lol, are you kidding me? That’s way too fucking dangerous.
 
(PCPG) I thought it wasn’t due to your professional presence, and besides, wouldn’t you rather keep people who know about this shit close?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) I guess, but we won’t discuss this here. Come over to my place and we can review lecture material. 

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Plus maybe, and that’s a huge giant fucking maybe, get you familiarized with the basics of atominous containment.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, happyMAX) Deal?

Despite the amount of discussion necessary to get any information out of the Davoo, he is a man of his word at least, and so I find myself in a small apartment near campus barely an hour after my last lecture.

(PCPG) Nice place.

(Davoo, campus, greeting, happyMIN, offleft, slide, center) Yeah, it’s all you could possibly need. It’s sorted and it’s easily accessible.
 
(PCPG) Why are there boxes under your monitor?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) So I don’t ever have to look down. Because if you do it a bit, it’s fine, 

(Davoo, campus, thinking) but if you keep looking downward at your monitor the entire time, your back starts to hurt and you get less productive and it’s a huge fucking downward spiral that’s completely optional.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, neutral) This is the perfect setup, like I said, you should try it.
 
(PCPG) And the VHS tapes under the keyboard serve what purpose?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Well I can’t just have my arms not be level./n
Why are you looking at me like I’m the crazy one, this is like the most basic shit when it comes to workplace comfort.
 
(PCPG) If you say so.
 
Sitting down at Davoo’s desk, I have to admit that It’s pretty comfortable despite the initial weirdness.

A message pops up on screen.

(???) Hey, 57593203786a, we need to talk about Project Convergence.
 
(PCPG) What’s that about?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, angryMIN) Don’t answer, it’s atominous.
 
(PCPG) Your computer?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) No, just this message board. It became corrupted and now it’s just a bunch of alternate universe iterations of myself getting into debates with each other.
 
(PCPG) Whoa, neat. But isn’t it a huge threat to keep this in your house?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) Yeah, they call themselves “the collective” and it’s pretty much the most complex corruption I have ever seen.
 
(PCPG) Have you at least tried disposing of it?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, shockMIN) No.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Well, yes, but not like “me” personally

(Davoo, campus, explaining, shockMIN) Other Davoos posted about their plans to contain it… Never heard from them again, so for now I’m just trying not to piss it off.
 
(PCPG) Guess I’ll leave it alone then. Still, that sounds fascinating, to have a bunch of alternative yous to talk to… 

(PCPG) does that sound self-absorbed?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMIN) It’s great for video game and anime suggestions, which encompasses most of the things they ever talk about. You almost forget how terrifyingly powerful it is.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, neutral) Do you want something to drink?
 
(PCPG) Coffee would be great.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) Sure, I’ll get some. Last time I got into coffee, I didn’t sleep for like three days straight, so I’ll probably stick to booze.
 
(PCPG) It’s barely 4 pm…
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Yeah, so? I don’t have any tasks ahead of me that require me to not be inebriated.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) It’s all about tailoring your beverage consumption to the mindset necessary to achieve maximum productivity.
 
(PCPG) If you say so. Still, I’ll stick to the caffeine since I haven’t slept in a hot minute.
 
Davoo sets a stein of coffee down in front of me, before helping himself to a bottle of vodka from the shelf.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, confusedMIN) So I’ve thought about the atominous thing for a while, and I really don’t know how to help you.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) There’s fucktons of containment equipment that I can’t just give to you since I need it myself, and there’s really no other way to deal with the little shits.
 
(PCPG) Well for starters, you could teach me how to spot them and then I could get you to dispose of them. I’d be less terrified to walk around school, and you would have a little less work.
 
(Davoo, campus, greeting, neutral) Good idea, here’s my number.
 
Hell yes, I’m in.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, neutral) Spotting atominous corruption isn’t that hard, you just keep an eye out for weird shit, but spotting atominous corruption at PCPU is an art in and of itself.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Essentially what you have to do is ask yourself if the weird shit can be explained by the close packing of illicit amounts of autism, or if it genuinely defies the laws of physics.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, confusedMIN) The line can be, and in most cases is, blurry.
 
(PCPG) So, pirates in the cafeteria: neurological deviants, changing text in textbook: atominous.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMIN) Yeah, exactly. Now do we want to get to the lecture material or what?
 
We spend a few hours going over notes, cross referencing episode directors and figuring out how to design a helpful and aesthetically pleasing PowerPoint presentation for Digi’s next class. 

All the while, Davoo gets increasingly more intoxicated.
 
(PCPG) You’re really fucking good at this self-directed learning thing. I never had to properly concern myself with that stuff during school, and it bit me in the ass when I got to uni.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkMIN) I was homeschooled, so that probably helped, but then again, there are some homeschool kids who never learn anything, 

(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkMIN) so I don’t know, maybe that’s an inherent character quality or something.
 
(PCPG) Maybe. Homeschooled huh? So were your parents religious nutjobs?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, drunkMIN) Well they are religious, but I wouldn’t call them nutjobs.
 
(PCPG) Sorry for the personal questions, I’m not trying to dig for shit here because of your inebriation. Anyways, I think I’m done here.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, drunkMAX) Whoa, so I drank a little, I still wouldn’t divulge information that I don’t want to. Everything I do is still deliberate.
 
(PCPG) You can’t honestly mean that.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunksmile) Well I do. Any fuckup on my end is merely a product of miscalculation when it comes to social norms.

(Davoo, campus, neutral, drunkMAX) The presentation’s pretty much ready to go too, so do you want to stay and watch some anime?

[Choice]

*Watch a short anime*
*Jokingly suggest watching a thirty second animation like a complete jackass*
*Decline*
 
*Watch a short anime*

(PCPG) Sure, have you seen Space Patrol Luluco?

(Davoo, campus, neutral, drunksmile) Hell yeah I have, but that show is infinitely rewatchable. Excellent choice!

*Jokingly suggest watching a thirty second animation like a complete jackass*

(PCPG) How about we watch Trigger-chan?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, drunkdrool) Lol, yeah, let’s torrent a half minute Luluco extra that has a MAL entry for some fucking reason.
 
(PCPG) It’s not like we can’t watch Luluco afterwards.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, drunksmile) But why would you watch it in that order?
 
(PCPG) I don’t know, it just seemed like a funny answer.

(PCPG) Nah, still haven’t figured out how to get rid of sleep completely, so I should really head home to get some shut-eye.

[Scene: Un-work-ethical]
 
The evening flies by, as I start drinking despite my previous intentions and we yell “justice gun morphing” at the screen.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkdrool) You know, when I first started, sitting down and actually watching anime was really hard for me.
 
(PCPG) How could it be hard?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkMIN) When you’re not used to that kind of thing, you start getting anxious after a while, like you should be doing something else, something productive.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkdrool) Because your brain hasn’t adjusted to the fact that media consumption can be a necessary, productive thing in certain situations.
 
(PCPG) Sure, I can see that. Are you fully adjusted to it now?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) Yeah, kind of. But I started thinking about that kind of thing again recently, 

(Davoo, campus, thinking) about that feeling that you should be doing something else, while doing another thing and how that in itself might be kind of counterproductive.
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) Like there’s always a delay before you can start a new task because there’s a certain time needed to readjust and refocus.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) So, when you keep alternating between a bunch of projects, you’re effectively losing time, but you also can’t just do one thing, because you’ll go insane after a while.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkdrool) I guess what I’m saying is that there probably is a magic number of things that can or should be worked on simultaneously and I’m almost definitely above that number.
 
Trying to uphold the appearance of productivity, which has admittedly led to some legit productivity in the past days das definitely taught me a thing or two about the effect that switching between tasks can have. 

But then again, I wasn’t really worried about min-maxing and I’m still stressed as all fuck. 

I can’t even imagine how stressful ACTUALLY trying to get things done might be.

(PCPG) Well no one’s forcing you to do all that stuff. I can help you with the atominous and there are probably other things that can be cut completely.
 
(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) Yeah but the problem is that I don’t really know what to cut, and I don’t think I want to cut anything. If I did, I wouldn’t have started doing it.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, drunkMIN) I also don’t really have a reference for what a healthy work environment even is, so I wouldn’t know if I’m fucking up or not.
 
(PCPG) It’s not about dropping things because you hate them, just about setting priorities.

(PCPG) No one ever knows if they’re fucking up or not before they’ve done it. You just have to see if things get better or worse, and if they get worse, you can hopefully go back.
 
(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) Huh, maybe I do need to get rid of some responsibilities.

[fade to black]
 
On my way home a message appears on my phone. I don’t recognize the number, but seeing as it is the middle of the night and I have nothing else to do, I open it. 

The message reads as such:/n
“We apologize for your inconvenience./n
-The Collective”

Is this supposed to be a joke?/n
Maybe this is a side effect of not having slept in a few days, but neither do I get it, nor do I manage to care. 

Without removing my clothes, I fall onto the bed to get at least an hour of shut-eye.

I’m barely out of the house when my phone vibrates.
 
(???) Hey stud.
 
(PCPG) Wow, what a bafflingly creepy opener. Who the fuck are you?
 
(???) Was that a second person plural or singular “you”?

(PCPG) ?

(???) Doesn’t matter. We are the collective, and you are on your way to woo this universe’s iteration of me/us.
 
(PCPG) We’re just friends, or maybe co-workers in a way…

(PCPG) ...a kinda fucked up supernatural way, but still.
 
(Davoo collective) Don’t bother lying to us. As a panmultiversal thinktank you learn to recognize patterns. 

(Davoo collective) And besides; did you know that versions of yourself ended up with pretty much every single person at PCPU?

(Davoo collective) At this point we doubt that you’re even capable of platonic affection.
 
(PCPG) How in the fuck are you even texting me, aren’t you confined to that message board?
 
(Davoo collective) We’d hardly qualify as autonomous if we weren’t capable of doing whatever we felt like, now would we?
 
(PCPG) Fair point. So I’m guessing you’re playing the upset father figure for yourself here and telling me to back off?

(PCPG) Because I won’t, I can’t really trust an atominous and this would be sort of fucked up even if you weren’t a threat to reality itself.
 
(Davoo collective) You’re right, that would be very strange. Which is why it’s not what we’re going for.

(Davoo collective) We simply want to apologize for taking your Davoo away. You see, the great convergence requires all Davoos, and yours will opt in like all the others.
 
(Davoo collective) And besides; we are not atominous./n
It is merely our communication with each other and you that is facilitated through atominous corruption.

(Davoo collective) That’s an important distinction to make.
 
(PCPG) Sooooo panmultiverse-one-person-human-instrumentality..? Great plan buddy.

(PCPG) Davoo would never go for that shit and you know it, so whatever your atominous ass is trying to sucker me into: I’m not falling for it./n

The strange appearances of some students at PCPU has stopped bothering me quite a while ago, and yet, I can’t stop my gaze from thoroughly examining the weird whiskers that seem to have appeared on Davoo’s face.

(Davoo, campus, greeting, catboy, offleft, slide, left)
 
(PCPG) So are you just incredibly unfortunate when it comes to beard growth or is this some new fashion trend I should be aware of?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, catboy) What are you talking about, meow meow snip snip?

(Davoo, campus, explaining, catboy) I am but a political pundit, roaming these woods in search of answers to the questions posed by partisan discourse.
 
(PCPG) Ha ha, the lack of sleep has finally caught up to me, I’m hallucinating!
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, catboy) Yes, but is it the president’s fault or a flaw inherent to the system? 

(Davoo, campus, neutral, catboy) Congress maybe? Meow meow snip snip.
 
(PCPG) I didn’t mean to say that out loud… could you get an ambulance?
 
(Davoo, campus, greeting, catboy) I’m not sure catboys such as myself are even capable of such tasks. The paws are a bit of a problem.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, catboy) Say, would you consider yourself to be politically well informed?/n
What news outlets do you follow?...
 
He starts talking about the wall as I run for the main building. There has to be a school nurse somewhere.

Strangely, everything else seems… well, normal, or normal by this school’s standards at least.

(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 4, shockMIN, offright, slide, right) Whoah, you look a bit distressed, what’s going on?
 
(PCPG) Have you seen Davoo today?/n
He’s acting kinda weird, right?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 2, HappyMAX) That’s the Davoo for you. When has he ever not acted weird?

(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 2, confusedMIN) Strange is his god damn modus operandi and you should know that by now.
 
(PCPG) Yeah, but in a very specific, easily recognizable way. This is different.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 5, confusedMIN) If you say so… Look, there he is right now, why don’t you ask him yourself?
 
He’s right, and maybe I was hallucinating after all, since the whiskers have vanished completely.

[SLIDE, Digi, offright]

(Davoo, campus, explaining, shockMIN, offleft, slide, center)
 
(PCPG) Hey Davoo, sorry I stormed off earlier. I was kind of having a psychotic break, but it’s okay now... I think.

[Digi leaves]
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, shockMIN) Who’s Davoo? I’m up and coming brony analyst and VHS collector Tapestack.
 
(PCPG) Tapestack? /n
I’m really having trouble figuring out which one of us is going insane.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, confusedMAX) Well clearly It’s me, since I’m talking to some kind of bipedal furless… what the fuck even are you?
 
(PCPG) The word you’re looking for is “human”.

(PCPG) What the fuck happened after I left yesterday?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, neutral) No idea what you’re talking about. Anyways, I’ve got to go, I have some analysis videos to record.

[SLIDE, Davoo, offright]
 
Okay, that’s it. 

Maybe I don’t know what’s going on, but I sure as fuck know who’s responsible./n
I take out my phone.

[Davoo leaves]

(PCPG) Yo, collective, what have you done to Davoo?
 
(Davoo collective) Terribly sorry for the inconvenience, but this is how it goes with the convergence. His personality destabilizes before he’s fully integrated.
 
(PCPG) I’m fully willing to transfer you to some kind of containment USB-stick if you don’t stop what you’re doing immediately.
 
(Davoo collective) Don’t you want to respect your friend’s decisions? He chose this, you know? All of us did.
 
(PCPG) And why in the hell would he do that?
 
(Davoo collective) The man’s got a lot on his plate, you know that. Isn’t it reasonable to share those responsibilities across infinitely many versions of yourself?
 
(PCPG) That’s an insane all-or-nothing solution. He’d never be happy with this.
 
(Davoo collective) Does he look unhappy to you?
 
I look back at Davoo and… Oh god… 

Why… why is he holding a diaper? 

Whatever facet of his personality this is; I’m really not sure I want to talk to it.
 
[Choice]

*I’m a gay little bitch baby and fetish talk makes me uncomfortable*
*He can’t be that bad, right?*
 
*I’m a gay little bitch baby and fetish talk makes me uncomfortable*

Tough titties, the universe doesn’t work like that. Sometimes you have to do scary things to help a friend and this is one of those times so fucking get over yourself.

*He can’t be that bad, right?*

Here goes nothing

(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMAX, offleft, slide, center)

(PCPG) Hey, you didn’t consent to some Faustian bargain that is slowly collapsing your personality, did you?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMAX) Yeah I did, or a version of me that is no longer relevant to this universe, maybe. Don’t you see how incredibly fucking hot that is conceptually though?

(Davoo, campus, explaining, happyMAX) Slowly losing your humanity through forces beyond comprehension?
 
(PCPG) I really don’t
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) It’s essentially the same as a mindbreak doujin, but with the overtly sexual elements removed, so that only the intrinsic degrading horror of the scenario itself remains.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Which is sexually gratifying in a fetishistic way all on it’s own, when you really look at it.
 
(PCPG) Well that is deeply fucking disturbing./n
Davoo, if you’re in there, please don’t put on that diaper and never talk about the allure of intrinsically degrading horror again.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, smittenMIN) Oh, I’m not interested in wearing this. I’m scouting for other people to do so.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) You see, ABDL as a form of erotic ageplay usually has only one party in the compromised position of the infant. 

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) The eroticism for the other party lies in the control aspect and their partners visually indicated dependence upon them.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral, center, slide, offright)

(PCPG) I’m out!

[Davoo leaves]
 
[Location: black]
[StopMusic]

(PCPG) What happened?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) Well I don’t know… apparently reality is collapsing or some shit.
 
(PCPG) Oh thank god you’re back.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Yeah, I’m talking to the guys to figure out what’s going on.
 
(PCPG) You mean the collective?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) No, well, maybe. I’m talking to my tulpas.
 
(PCPG) Like headmates?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) Yeah, basically. Headmates of myself, which in turn have tulpas of themselves and so on.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMAX) One of them is telling me that my existence is the penultimate step in the collective’s completion.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMAX) Which is nice I guess; being able to distribute tasks across infinitely many iterations of yourself.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMAX) Finally being as insane as you always wanted to be.
 
(PCPG) And the darkness plays into that how exactly?
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, happyMIN) That’s the final step.
 
And just like that, we vanish.

Wow. My first day at PCP University! 
 
My last school threw me out for being too retarded and not being able to finish my assignments.

Will this place be any better? Who knows, I might finally find some friends or even …

Love?

[CG end]
 
A cool breeze greets me this morning.
 
As I pass the entrance to the dinky alley, a slim guy with fluffy hair nearly walks straight into me.
 
(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN) Oh whoops, I didn't see you there. Are you on your way to school too?
 
'Too'? He’s a student then?
 
(PCPG) Yeah, PCP University. Do you go there?
 
(Gibbon, campus, clenched, happyMED) Well given how it’s the only school in the city, yeah. Oh uh, the name's Gibbontake by the way.
 
(PCPG) I’m PCPG, but, aren't you going the wrong way? I’m new to Boston, but I thought the university was... wait shit, maybe I was looking at the Newgle Maps app upside-down...
 
(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN) Well yeah, it is over that way, if you wanna take the main roads. But I like this shortcut through the alleyways.

(Gibbon, campus, default, happyMIN) Actually, you wanna walk with me? I could show you around the neighbourhood and tell you about the school and stuff.
 
I fail to see how backtracking through the alleys is a shortcut. But this guy seems friendly enough, and I set out early on purpose. Eh, what's the harm?
 
(PCPG) Sure! We can get to know each other too. Maybe we're in some of the same classes! So, what do you study...?
 
As we walk and talk and we both learn that we have the same class schedule for today, so he offers to show me around campus.

At this point though I’m worried we won't make it without being mugged, this place definitely doesn’t seem safe. I swear I saw a disheveled man lurking in the shado-
 
[Location: waytoschool.jesse]
 
Ah!
 
There he is! What's he doing crouching over a manhole cover?
 
He screams desperately into the sewers. 
 
(Jesse) DONATELLO! Come back to me! Come on, dude!
 
(PCPG) Is... is that guy okay, Gib?
 
(Gibbon, campus, handsup, neutral) Oh don't mind the Sewer Priest, he's always like that.
 
I take Gib at his word and turn my attention away from the loud ‘Priest’. I can't help but feel sorry for him though, if this is normal. The government should do something about the homeless.
 
As the alleyway opens back up, I see the silhouette of the University peeking out from behind the houses, etching its bizarre shape into the skyline.

(Gibbon, campus, clenched, happyMED) Anyways, welcome to PCP University!
 
This isn’t right, I’m having the weirdest sensation of déjà vu. I know this school and I knew how to get there, but those didn’t seem like the things I was supposed to say and to think in a way… my head hurts. 

Maybe it’s just the stress of changing schools.

Gibbon and I wander the halls of the university. Gib seems to know where he is going and I too feel strangely at home. Suddenly a powerful voice booms from behind us.
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, happyMED|shades, offleft, slide, center) Hello puny students!
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, happyMIN|shades) Oh, I haven’t seen you around before. Are you new here?
 
(PCPG) Yes, but we have met. You’re Nate, right? I just can’t remember how.
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, shockMIN|shades) I see; my reputation precedes me. Well I hope you aspire to follow in my footsteps then, and if you aren’t willing to put in the effort to succeed at this school, I WILL end you.
 
Nate steps closer to me. All of a sudden his once captivating muscles become intimidating, and his voice shifts to a serious tone.
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) Do you plan to excel at this university? As a teacher, I want to see all my students become the greatest version of themselves. 

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, happyMIN|shades) And I will do everything in my power to see that through to the end.
 
I suddenly find myself having flashbacks to my last school. I cannot help but remember all the unfinished homework assignments, all the failed tests...
 
(PCPG) Uhh… Yeah…
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, papers, sadMIN|shades) You don’t sound so sure of yourself. Oh well, just know that if you fail to meet standards I will not hesitate to take action. I HAVE principles!
 
Great…
 
(Action giraffe, gesture1, neutral, offleft, slide, left)

A cool looking giraffe catches the teacher’s attention.
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, shockMIN|shades) Oh hey Action Giraffe, how’s it going?

Okay, that’s enough
 
(PCPG) He has AIDS. I know this shit./n
Why the fuck is everything repeating, I’m losing my mind.
 
Here’s the headache again. It’s like the universe is trying to prevent me from addressing its state of being utterly fucked.
 
[SLIDE, actiongiraffe, offleft]
 
(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, angryMIN|shades) That’s really not how you should treat students with life threatening illnesses PCPG!

(Nate|Professor Bestman, campus, standing, angryMED|shades) Despite his disease, he still strives towards accomplishing his dreams and that’s pretty fucking inspirational if you ask me.

[ActionGiraffe leaves]

I simply head to music class by myself since Nate is furious and Gib is off somewhere comforting a goddamn giraffe.

We reach the music classroom. Gib and I sit down adjacent to one another. A scruffy man enters the room, obviously drunk.

Wait, that’s not right. “We” reach the classroom?

Gib stayed back with action giraffe./n
I walked here alone.

We did not arrive together. 

But we did.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, Campus, 4, HappyMAX) Heyyy everybody! Welcome to Music Class!
 
The class passes the same way it did last time and I go along with it out of fear that my head might explode otherwise. 

I even fall asleep, seeing how that’s apparently a key element of the pseudo deterministic hell that I was thrown into.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 2, confusedMED) Are you getting any of this?
 
(PCPG) Yeah. Music and stuff right?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 1, happyMAX) Good. There’s gonna be a quiz on all that stuff I just told you next Friday. Your homework is to watch ten Anthony Fantano videos, or don’t. Class dismissed.
 
Finally class is over. I have to talk to someone about what’s been going on, and Professor Digibro seems just detached enough from reality to be a promising candidate.
 
I approach Digi. The closer I get to him, the more details I can see of his slovenly yet strangely handsome appearance. He looks a bit like Jesus, in a way. 

No, brain, stop telling me what to think! I know how he looks.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 1, happyMIN) Oh, hey new kid, how do you like the class so far? I hope you enjoyed the subject, because you’re going to be hearing a lot more about it.
 
(PCPG) Yeah it was… interesting… Say, you don’t feel like this day has happened before, do you?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 1, angryMIN) If you’ve heard this shit before, that’s fine, none of it is that advanced, 

(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 1, angryMIN) but if you look around in the class, you’ll see that a lot of these guys need to be spoon-fed the basics first.
 
(PCPG) That’s not what I mean. I mean the day is actually repeating wholesale, all of this stuff happened weeks ago, almost verbatim.

(PCPG) We met in the library after school, and you recommended me boogiepop… Or maybe I went to a convenience store belonging to a former U.S. president?

(PCPG) Something along those lines.

(PCPG) Look, there are a bunch of overlapping memories, but you have to believe me.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 1, confusedMIN) Overlapping memories? Do you mean the Mandela effect or something?
 
(PCPG) What? No! Well... maybe? Some details are wrong.

(PCPG) When I try to stray from the path that things went down originally, I get a headache like right now, but there’s also other stuff… everything is just so wrong.
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 1, shockMIN) Are you having a mental breakdown? Because I might have to call the police on you.
 
(PCPG) No, I’m… fine. Just a little stressed… sorry for the inconvenience.

All these repeats of previous interactions have left me starving. I can’t wait to chow down.
As I push open the doors to the cafeteria, I am greeted by a familiar scene… next up is Mage, I guess.
 
(Mage, campus, 1, HappyMED) Hey! I haven’t seen you around before.
 
Yes you did… 

Better to just play along with the conversation./n
Resistance is so incredibly tiring.

I catch up to Gib waiting for me in the line as I look up at the menu options, which consist of the usual coloured pills, like forty strains of weed, huel, and of course, pizza, 

cause every place has to have fucking pizza apparently.

[SLIDE, Mage, center, offleft]

[Mage leaves]
 
(Gibbon, campus, Grabby, happyMIN) I hear the BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza is pretty good, never tried it though.
 
I look through the pizza options and confirm that Gib’s suggestion is far too rich for my poor boi wallet. In fact, this whole menu is unreasonably priced. 

Chicken and Tea is sadly sold out.
 
(PCPG) Chicken and tea plus the premium would be cheaper than all of this shit…/n
Theft is what that is.
 
(Gibbon, campus, default, confusedMED) The premium?
 
(PCPG) Yeah, that’s a thing Davoo used to say… I just thought it was funny
 
[screen shake]
 
(Gibbon, campus, default, confusedMED) Is that someone from your old school?
 
(PCPG) No, he’s… wait, you don’t know who Davoo is?

(PCPG) Digi!
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 2, confusedMAX) What? Have you reconsidered having a mental breakdown?
 
(PCPG) Depends. Who makes your PowerPoint presentations for the Japanese class?
 
(Digi|Professor Digibro, campus, 5, confusedMED) I make them myself of course. I’s the most annoying task imaginable, and I really should outsource it, but I just don’t trust anyone enough to do that.
 
(PCPG) Well you did trust someone in the other universe. The Davoo! Remember?

(PCPG) Please tell me you remember!
 
[Screen shake]
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) Don’t do this.
 
(PCPG) Don’t do what?
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) We gave you a new world in which you could live unimpeded by our influence and you are ruining it for yourself
 
(PCPG) The collective.

(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) Do you know how much of a hassle it is to build a new reality? Luckily we have the manpower now, but you still can’t just shit on it like that.

(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) You can’t treat us like we’re the guys who sneezed on Steve Jobs, making him fatally ill and ruining humanity forever. 

(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) You know what? We’ll stop talking to you.

(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) Be happy about your second chance, will you.

(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) Wait, that’s it?
 
(PCPG) I think it’s an awful idea, but you chose this and hell, who am I to tell you how to live your life.
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) So you’re just gonna repeat your first few weeks and then what?
 
(PCPG) Whoa, no, there’s no way I’m doing that. You’re god.

(PCPG) You literally made this universe, so I want to not have a headache whenever I change the course of events, I want to be Bezos levels of stupidly rich, 

(PCPG) I want to be the most attractive person on earth, but only to people I’m interested in and I want to be able to fly.
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) Lol, sure, we guess we can make that happen. Anything else?
 
(PCPG) Make lightning strike twice right behind me when I tell someone that I’m friends with god and erase my memory of having spoken to diaper-Davoo.
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) He’s laughing his ass off, but no problem.

(PCPG) So you have two options. Three actually, but you’re not gonna kill me.

(PCPG) So you can restart again and again without there being any reason for it to work next time or the one after that, or you can have an actual conversation like the group of adults that you are.
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) Alright then, but we don’t know what there is to talk about.
 
(PCPG) The work environment you were in wasn’t the healthiest, I’m sure you realized that, but this stupid-ass convergence shit isn’t helpful.

(PCPG) You’re more efficient as a collective, sure, but you’re more efficient at making garbage.

(PCPG) A worthwhile product requires outside influence and inspiration and reflection on things that aren’t internal to yourself. That’s what you came to PCPU for, didn’t you?
 
(Digi|P r 0f e220r >ig ibr 0, campus, 1, neutral) We have thought about this, all of us have, but there is no easy solution.
 
(PCPG) Of course there isn’t, because you have to cut back on things, and you have to accept that you’re not omnipotent and that has to be hard.

(PCPG) But I’m sure with all of that brainpower you have realized that nothing of any artistic value can come from this fused state, so just give up, reorganize, and we can figure this out together.

It’s scary how fast life gets back to normal, or back to the absurd state of affairs that one has come to call normal despite the term being completely inapplicable. 

Still, if feels nice, eating my greens as Davoo sits down with a ludicrous pile of food in front of me. 

It has occurred to me that one usually doesn’t confront what is by all reasonable standards a god for just any friend. 

I really should ask Davoo out on a date… Maybe I can even get him to go to that fabled RadProm with me..

(Davoo, campus, thinking)
 
(PCPG) So is this what the premium is supposed to get you?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) No, but one of these dishes is definitely atominous.
 
(PCPG) How do you know?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Some students were corrupted during lunch… One guy straight up became intangible and fell through the floor, so he’s probably dead.
 
Great, what an amazing situation to broach the topic of romance.
 
(PCPG) Speaking of atominous, how was your time as borg god?
 
(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) Short-lived and kind of a letdown, though I did manage to watch all anime ever made before Digi.
 
(PCPG) Sure, but it must have still been interesting. Did you feel like a person still, just very interconnected, or was it actually some new kind of being that formed?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) We decided pretty quickly that thinking about the nature of our existence and how the concept of personhood does or doesn’t apply is kind of an overused trope.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) All possible conclusions have been written about. 

(Davoo, campus, thinking) We know the interesting part, which is that they exist and what they are, so what’s the point of figuring out which category we fell into?
 
(PCPG) You weren’t interested at all?
 
(Davoo, campus, thinking) Thinking about the nature of your being is more of a human problem and sort of a waste of time if you’re basically omnipotent.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) You could always do something that’s more alluring in the moment.
 
(PCPG) I guess… say, do you want to go on a date with me? To the amusement park or something.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, sadMAX) Sure, but not there. They rebuilt it and everything about the new design philosophy sucks ass bitch shit.

(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) Also the screams of the guests got vastly worse somehow.
 
(PCPG) We could go to Saturn then. Uh, the planetarium, I mean.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, happyMIN) Okay, tomorrow?
 
(PCPG) Perfect.
 
(PCPG) Did you end up finding the atominous?

(Davoo, campus, explaining, neutral) Yeah, It was the couscous.
 
(PCPG) What couscous?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) The grains are extremely long, so they look exactly like rice, but when you examine them closer, the word “Couscous” is written on every grain.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Maybe that’s why they’re so long, to make room for text?
 
(PCPG) Weird.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, happyMAX) Welp, into the containment organic waste bag it goes.

Above us, 62 moons speed past each other in somewhat concentric orbits around a beringed planet. 

I didn’t actually count them, but the speaker voice said so a few minutes ago and I’m choosing to remember this fact as an interesting tidbit to mention from time to time. 

It’s weirdly comforting in a way; knowing that there are objects so massive and old as to render humans and their silly little pursuits utterly inconsequential, knowing that there is no way we could possibly fuck this up. 

How would one fuck up Saturn? I literally can’t think of a way.

(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) You promised me an answer, you know? As to how I can restructure my life in a way that would maximize happiness and productivity. I didn’t forget about that.
 
(PCPG) No I didn’t. Also, I gave you an answer. You found it yourself in one universe… They’re all so blurred together, I can’t remember which one I really experienced.
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, angryMIN) Sorry about that… I feel the same way if it’s any help, but just telling me to get rid of some tasks isn’t actually an answer, it’s more like a prompt for an answer.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Like when you take a joker in a gameshow and the number of possible options is halved; that’s not giving an answer.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) It just makes picking the correct one through dumb luck more likely.
 
(PCPG) No idea where you’re going with the game show thing, but fair enough… what’s on your plate currently then?
 
(Davoo, campus, explaining, smittenMAX) There’s the powerpoints for Digi, the atominous, school in general, the video game I’m working on, other odd-jobs like cleaning rocks or plugging cords into things, and you… kind of.

(Davoo, campus, explaining, confusedMIN) Also some general self-care, but I can’t really drop that…/n
Decisions: the biggest problem in the universe.
 
(PCPG) You never even told me about a game. That seems like it should take priority.
 
(Davoo, campus, neutral, sadMIN) Yeah, I don’t want to make a habit of talking too much about it before it’s out. I’ve made some smaller ones before as I impossibly maneuver around all of my other jobs.

(Davoo, campus, fidgeting) I’ve never told you about the rock cleaning either, I think.

(PCPG) That wasn’t a joke? Either way, I doubt it’s particularly important.

(Davoo, campus, thinking) Maybe you’re right, this stuff isn’t normal and perhaps that’s a good thing.

A few days have passed since we met at the planetarium and I have hardly heard from Davoo since, which is my fault I guess, but I honestly just wanted him back in my reality. 

I didn’t actually think the things I said through. I just tried to be convincing… 

Someone sits down next to me.

(Gibbon, campus, handsup, smittenMAX|blushies, offleft, slide, left) 
 
(PCPG) Hey Gib, how’s it going?
 
(Gibbon, campus, handsup, smittenMAX|blushies) Oh it’s going great, I’m taking the loveliest girl to RadProm, she’s cool and she’s confident and maybe she’s kind of a bitch in the way that is like good?

(Gibbon, campus, press, smittenMED|blushies) Unfortunately she doesn’t have horns, but that’s okay.
 
(PCPG) How can one be a bitch in a good way? Also why would she have horns?
 
(Gibbon, campus, press, smittenMIN|blushies) She’s mean, but in a way that’s kind of aspirational… have you read Homestuck?
 
(PCPG) Yes, and can we please stop talking about RadProm? It’s depressing.
 
(Gibbon, campus, grabby, shockMED) Why? Don’t you have a date yet?
 
(PCPG) He sort of ghosted me, there’s a tragic scarcity of both pretzel buns and Davoo around here…

As to be expected; Gib was right. Davoo and Digi are dancing around the auditorium as I am sulking in the corner.

There’s still more than one Davoo.

(PCPG) No, I mean did I screw up my relationship with the real Davoo?
 
(Davoo collective) He’s not any more real than the rest of us. Hell, he isn’t even really the proper version of your universe’s Davoo anymore with all those extra memories he has now.
 
(PCPG) You know exactly what I mean
 
(Davoo collective) Then yes, yes you did.
 
(PCPG) Wow, harsh.

(PCPG) You can’t say that with any certainty, it might not have worked out anyways.
 
(Davoo collective) We actually literally can though.

(Davoo collective) First of all; we are him. We’re pretty confident that we can predict our own behavior and secondly; there are those among us who are at RadProm with you right now.

(Davoo collective) They’re not posting currently, because obviously they’re occupied, but yeah, they exist.
 
(PCPG) Then where did I go wrong?
 
(Davoo collective) You could have literally told him to remove Digi, a romantic competitor, from his life. That seems like the obvious strategy to go with.
 
(PCPG) But you love working for Digi!

(Davoo collective) You said that this wasn’t going to be an easy choice yourself… well, some versions of yourself actually meant that.
 
(PCPG) What do you mean some versions of myself meant it? I am literally them./n
I meant every word I said
 
(Davoo collective) No, you’re not.

(Davoo collective) You are similar, but if you were the same person, you would have made the same decision as them in the exact same situation, which you didn’t.

(Davoo collective) Versions of yourself romanced pretty much every student and teacher at PCPU, and they too are different from you as they would not have pursued various relationships, were they not.

(Davoo collective) Decisions are sort of the parameters by which our character is defined.
 
(PCPG) So you’re saying this always would have happened.
 
(Davoo collective) You giving the wrong answer is a possible outcome, therefore it had to occur in some instances of reality, such as yours.
 
(PCPG) But I AM me, an amalgam of me-s even, and therefore in some weird way more myself than any individual iteration. How could I possibly fuck up?
 
(Davoo collective) You’re not though. Or maybe you are…

(Davoo collective) It kind of depends on whether your definition of self aligns with that of the universe
 
(PCPG) What does that even mean, how could the universe itself have a “definition” for anything, we were just thrown into one consciousness with every being that shares our exact genetic makeup.

(PCPG) There’s nothing more to it.
 
(Davoo collective) Yeah, that would seem sensible, right; for the universe to function on the basis of cut and dry rules relating to easily measurable parameters like genetic code?

(Davoo collective) But that obviously isn’t the case.
 
(PCPG) How so?
 
(Davoo collective) Well first of all; Tapestack is a literal fucking horse. I doubt that he shares a lot of my genetics.

(Davoo collective) And secondly, there is nothing prohibiting someone with your code from having experienced severe trauma, 

(Davoo collective) or from having grown up in an entirely different culture, or a post apocalyptic wasteland.

(Davoo collective) So those things necessarily have to have occurred in at least one universe. Yet you probably don’t have any memories of that kind of stuff.

(Davoo collective) Our personalities would be completely disjointed and incomprehensible if that were the case. We wouldn’t be recognizably “us.”
 
(PCPG) Well, we live in Boston, so I definitely remember a post apocalyptic wasteland.
 
(Davoo collective) Lol, but you get what I’m saying. Heck, I’m sure you don’t have memories of anyone who didn’t go to this school.

(Davoo collective) I don’t either.
 
(PCPG) Okay, so genetics is irrelevant and what matters more is some vague concept of “personality.”
 
(Davoo collective) Exactly, there’s some completely arbitrary line which denotes the amount of character similarity required to make people part of the same panuniversal self, 

(Davoo collective) and it’s weirdly… I don’t know… convenient?
 
(PCPG) So what, are you telling me that god is real?
 
(Davoo collective) That’s one explanation, another is that the universe we live in isn’t.

(Davoo collective) That it’s a simulation by made by people who sit behind the mega sci fi equivalent of monitors and tweak variables to make this shit happen, which is kinda the same thing, I guess.
 
(PCPG) Atominous do seem a bit like glitches
 
(Davoo collective) Exactly. So if you get right down to it; this might be why you failed.

(Davoo collective) Someone decided that you would, because you had to, to facilitate the tenuous “reality” of this iteration of the timeline, which also had to exit for some convoluted reason.
 
(PCPG) Well, to that person, fuck you.
 
~Bad end~

Get it together PCPG, it’s a day like any other apart from the fact that I’m dating the man of my dreams./n
Hopefully, at least. 

Truth be told, Davoo hasn’t talked to me much over the past few days and I’m really hoping that this is just his general elusive nature. 

I know that I shouldn’t harass him, but at the same time it’s a bit unsettling, isn’t it?/n
What if he changed his mind and chose Digi over me? 

Not that I could blame him. That guy has seen WAY more anime than me. 

So much more, in fact, that I have almost considered bringing up the diaper thing to win him over for good, but alas I couldn’t find the courage. 

Get it together!/n
I’m PCPG, I have talked god into disbanding, I can do this.

I see Digi before I do Davoo. He’s off to the side, smoking pot with a delinquent girl as it seems. Good for him. Suddenly, I feel a tap on my shoulder.
 
(Davoo, special, smittenMIN)
 
(PCPG) Hey, looking great!
 
(Davoo, special, sadMIN) Thanks. Sorry that I dropped off the radar for a while.
 
(PCPG) You definitely had me worried for a bit, what was going on?
 
(Davoo, special, neutral) Well, I had to completely restructure my daily schedule. So it’s kind of easier to get used to everything if there aren’t any outside distractions.

(PCPG) So you really quit, huh?
 
(Davoo, special, neutral) Yeah… I think I’m happy about it.

(Davoo, special, smittenMIN) I don’t really know yet, If that makes any sense. 

(Davoo, special, smittenMIN) I’m definitely realizing more and more how much I’ve locked myself into a certain mode of operation, which it’s probably good to be out of.

(Davoo, special, smittenMIN) But that’s hard to measure by any kind of objective standards, so my mood and creative output are really the only thing I can go by while being almost impossible to quantify.
 
(PCPG) Meaning what exactly?
 
(Davoo, special, happyMIN) That I’ll have to wait and see, I guess. Surely if I made a huge mistake, I’ll notice at some point.
 
(PCPG) That makes sense… I don’t think that freedom to readjust and reconsider can be a bad thing, and Digi seems to be doing alright as well.

(PCPG) Anyways, how’s the game going?
 
(Davoo, special, happyMIN) I’ve made a ton of progress. Time hardly felt like it was passing with all of this manic energy I’ve had. But is that really what you want to talk about that right now?
 
(PCPG) Right… of course… that isn’t the most relevant thing right now, is it?

(PCPG) Did you find a way of dealing with the collective?
 
Oh god I’m getting flustered. I don’t know if I can do this.

[Song: PCPDating_Beloved]
 
(Davoo, special, smittenMAX) No, that’s not what I meant. Look, maybe I’m misreading social cues here, but this is prom night…
 
(PCPG) Yeah, I guess it is. Right now, I don’t really want to talk about anything at all. That is to say… I think… what I actually want is…
 
[fade to black]
 
I close my eyes and lean toward Davoo, hoping that he’s able to read the situation. After barely a moment of waiting, his lips…

Nope, nothing happens.

[fade from black]

(PCPG) Hey, um, that was the cue, in case you were wondering.

(Davoo, special, smittenMAX) Yeah, I know. I have consumed enough media to know that, which is kinda the problem, you know.

(Davoo, special, shockedMIN) I don’t want to be cliche about this. Deriving some vapid enjoyment from playing the bishi in a trite performance of a societal idea of romance is probably fine and all, 

(Davoo, special, shockedMIN) but it wouldn’t be satisfying in a greater sense. 

(Davoo, special, smittenMAX) The whole “I love you” thing would just be a shtick at that point, so I need to find a better way of saying all this. 

God damn it, I should have seen that one coming.

(PCPG) Well, I’m sure that you just said the “I love you”-thing in a way which no one ever has, and for good reason, 

(PCPG) so I’m gonna go ahead and kiss you now out of fear that this might become an essay on the rampant sameyness of confession scenes in mass media.

(Davoo, special, smittenMAX) What?!

[fade to black]
 
(PCPG) I love you.
 
~Good end~
