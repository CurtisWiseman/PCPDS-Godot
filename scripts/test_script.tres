My Name:
I'm PCPG and it's my first day at PCP University!
[CG: Battle Builder]

*Choice 1*
My last school threw me out for being too retarted and not being able to finish my assignments.
Will this place be any better? Who knows, I might finally find some friends or even ...Love?

As I walk by the entrance to a dinky alley on my way to campus, a slim guy with fluffy hair nearly walks straight into me.
