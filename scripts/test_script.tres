Wow. My first day at PCP University!
This is the kind of school I’ve always dreamed of! A whole class dedicated to Memes? Seems like the internet is finally old enough now to get a break into our educational system.

My last school threw me out for being too retarted and not being able to finish my assignments.
Will this place be any better? Who knows, I might finally find some friends or even ...Love?
